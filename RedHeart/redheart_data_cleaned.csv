Two days before her death, Andrea's niece called 000 after Pickett pulled a knife on Andrea.

After finding Kieffen, police ruled he had drowned by accident and did not investigate any further. A coronial inquest was held with the coroner ruling there was not enough evidence to say Kieffen's death was accidental and it was quite likely he was murdered. This included the fact that Kieffen was unlikely to wander off, he was afraid of water, he had lacerations that were most likely inflicted on him by another person and because there were two large rocks in his shorts.

Gavrilovic then killed himself. Evelina spent 22 years being controlled and violently abused by Gavrilovic. When she finally found the strength to leave, Gavrilovic tracked her down, forcing her to run from place to place. No matter where she went he always found her and the police failed to act. *Just trying to get an AVO from the police seemed to be a big issue - right up until she was killed we were trying to get the AVO, and we would report breaches of the interim order and the police would do nothing,* a support worker who tried to help Evelina said. *It was left to her co-workers to escort her to her car and keep her safe.* An interim apprehended violence order was granted in February of 2006, but Gavrilovic disregarded it. Just hours before he killed Evelina, Gavrilovic bought a bunch of red roses. He took them to the shopping centre where she worked, accosting her in the car park. He argued with Evelina before shooting her in the head and chest. Evelina died in a police officer's arms with the roses beside her, covered in blood. Evelina's murder was the inspiration for the Red Rose Rally movement, in which families, friends, activists and concerned community members gather to hold silent protests every time someone is killed as a result of domestic and family violence in Australia.

Ciara Glennon disappeared from Claremont about 14 months after Sarah went missing. Sarah, Ciara and Jane were suspected of being murdered by Bradley Robert Edwards. In 2016. Edwards was charged with their murders and in October of 2020 he was convicted over the killing of Ciara and Jane.  Edwards - during a judge only trial - was acquitted of the murder of Sarah. The trial judge said while he believed Edwards killed Sarah there simply was not enough evidence to convict him of her murder. *Sarah was really cool. She was just a beautiful person. I remember always thinking I really hope she likes me, just because she was such a lovely girl. She was really funny and very dry with her humour,* Sarah's friend Brodie Hudson told a media outlet in December, 2016.  Edwards is yet to be sentenced (October, 2020).

If she was still alive when she reached the bottom of the shaft, she was given no chance of survival once she was buried.* Alavija was sentenced to life in prison with parole after 20 years.

A man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was acquitted of Evelyn and Clinton's murders at separate trials in 1997 and 2006. That same man has been re-charged over Evelyn and Clinton's deaths. The families of Evelyn, Clinton and Colleen spent 25 years lobbying to have the three cases heard together. However, NSW's double jeopardy laws need to be circumvented for this to happen. The NSW Attorney-General has submitted an application to the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal to have the man face trial again.

Her car was found on October 2, 1919, covered in parking tickets. It had been thoroughly cleaned. Police believe Helen's killer dumped the car after using it to transport her body to an unknown location. Courtney's family have spoken of the violence Helen endured throughout her marriage. *I can also remember the nights we spent at shelters to get out of the house,* Helen's son Jai told a media outlet in September, 2016. *I was wondering what had happened to her. It was a shock - one minute she's there and the next she's gone. I know how close I was with Mum. For her to not contact me at all, if she was still alive she would have. I knew that deep down and my grandparents did, too. I knew something wasn't right. I have no doubt who is responsible, it's just a matter of proving that.* Police have identified a male suspect but he has not yet been charged. A $200,000 reward is available for anyone providing information leading to the confirmation of Helen's killer.

Margaret was one of six women killed by Glover over 14 months in 1989-1990. Glover also murdered Joan Sinclair, Gwendolin Mitchelhill, Olive Cleveland, Muriel Falconer and Winifreda Ashton.   Glover attacked Margaret on the back of the head with a blunt instrument. When she fell to the ground Glover stole her handbag and left. Her body was found a short time later. Glover stole $300 from Margaret's purse.  Glover came to police attention in 1990 after he molested an elderly patient at a hospital. Medical staff called police. Officers tracked him down and a few weeks later left him a note requesting he come in to see them. He took an overdose of tablets and wrote a suicide note with the words *no more grannies*. The information was passed to police investigating the so called granny killings and Glover was arrested. He pleaded not guilty due to diminished responsibility but he was convicted. During the trial it emerged he had a poker machine addiction and the easiest way to feed his habit was to bash and rob elderly women. He was sentenced to consecutive life terms and killed himself in 2005.

The men bashed her then forced her to perform sex acts on them once they had her in their car. They used her money to fuel the vehicle before driving her to a secluded paddock where they raped and bashed her multiple times. Travers then slit her throat because he was worried she could identify him and the others. Anita's body was found in the paddock two days after she was killed. All of the men were arrested and charged within 22 days of Anita's death. On June 10, 1987, all five killers were found guilty of sexual assault and murder. They were all sentenced to life in jail and their files were marked never to be released. *This was one of the most horrifying physical and sexual assaults,* Justice Alan Maxwell said during their sentencing. *This was a calculated killing done in cold blood.* Anita's parents Garry and Grace Lynch started the Homicide Victims' Support Group in memory of their daughter.

Also charged with Marlene's kidnapping was Stuart Binion and a 41-year-old Moe man. In April, 2011, McDonald was convicted of Marlene's murder. He was also found to have stalked Marlene relentlessly, subjected her to abuse and after she disappeared, McDonald set about destroying the good memories the children had of their mum. *Quite understandably, they do not believe that you have poisoned their minds; but there was much evidence before the court that you are an accomplished liar and a manipulator of others,* Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth said. *And over the many years since her death, you told the children a series of lies about Marlene, including perhaps the most terrible lie of all - that their mother had simply run away and abandoned them, for her own selfish reasons, when you knew full well that you had murdered her.* During his sentencing, Marlene's daughters read victim impact statements that painted their mother as a moody drug user who had abandoned them. They all claimed their father was innocent. *My mother never showed any motherly interest and paid no interest in us at all. I truly believe I have missed out on a mother daughter bond because she wasn't prepared to give the time or develop it,* one of the children said. *In my eyes my dad is my knight in shining armour, he is my rock, my solid rock of comfort. His arms are where I have felt most comfort and have been a safe haven for my siblings and myself.* McDonald was sentenced to 19 years in jail with parole after 13 years. He is eligible for release in 2024. He appealed the conviction but it was thrown out. Marlene's body has not been found. "

No one has been charged with Josephine's murder but it is believed she was victim of John Wayne Glover who murdered at least six other women. Glover was convicted of the murders of Muriel Falconer, Joan Sinclair, Margaret Pahud, Olive Cleveland, Gwendolin Mitchelhill and Winfreda Ashton (see separate entries). It is also suspected that he killed Emmie May Anderson, 78, in East Melbourne (October 19, 1961); Irene Kiddle, 61, St Kilda (March 22, 1963); Elsie Boyes, 63, Prahran (June 3, 1967); Christina Yankos, 63, Albert Park (April 9, 1968); Florence Broadhurst, 78, Paddington (October 16, 1977); and Wanda Amundsen, 83, Umina (November 21, 1986).  Glover came to police attention in 1990 after he molested an elderly patient at a hospital. Medical staff called police. Officers tracked him down and a few weeks later left him a note requesting he come in to see them. He took an overdose of tablets and wrote a suicide note with the words *no more grannies*. The information was passed to police investigating the so called granny killings and Glover was arrested. He pleaded not guilty due to diminished responsibility but he was convicted. During the trial it emerged he had a poker machine addiction and the easiest way to feed his habit was to bash and rob elderly women. He was sentenced to consecutive life terms and killed himself in 2005. * NOTE: The RED HEART Campaign is seeking photos of Joan Sinclair,  Emmie May Anderson,  Elsie Boyes, Christina Yankos and  Florence Broadhurst.

No one has been charged with Florence's murder but it is believed she was a victim of John Wayne Glover who murdered at least six other women. Glover was convicted of the murders of Muriel Falconer, Joan Sinclair, Margaret Pahud, Olive Cleveland, Gwendolin Mitchelhill and Winfreda Ashton.

Glover came to police attention not long before he killed Joan Sinclair, after he molested an elderly patient at a hospital. Medical staff called police. Officers tracked him down and a few weeks later left him a note requesting he come in to see them.  He was under police surveillance when he went to Joan's home. Around three hours later officers realised there was no movement. Six hours later they entered the property to find Joan dead. Her head had been beaten with a hammer and her clothing was wrapped around her neck. Glover also sexually violated her, although it is not known if she was alive when he did this. He denied raping her. Police found him in Joan's bathtub.  He had overdosed on tablets and wrote a suicide note with the words *no more grannies*. He pleaded not guilty due to diminished responsibility but he was convicted. During the trial it emerged he had a poker machine addiction and the easiest way to feed his habit was to bash and rob elderly women. He was sentenced to consecutive life terms and killed himself in 2005. NOTE: The RED HEART Campaign is seeking photos of Joan Sinclair, Emmie May Anderson, Elsie Boyes and Christina Yankos.

It is also suspected that he killed Wanda Amundsen (November 21, 1986); Emmie May Anderson, 78, East Melbourne (October 19, 1961); Irene Kiddle, 61, St Kilda (March 22, 1963); Elsie Boyes, 68, St Kilda (1967); Florence Broadhurst, 78, Paddington (October 15, 1977); and Josephine McDonald, 72, Ettalong (August 29, 1984). Glover came to police attention not long before he killed Joan Sinclair, after he molested an elderly patient at a hospital. Medical staff called police. Officers tracked him down and a few weeks later left him a note requesting he come in to see them.  He was under police surveillance when he went to Joan's home. Around three hours later officers realised there was no movement. Six hours later they entered the property to find Joan dead. Her head had been beaten with a hammer and her clothing was wrapped around her neck. Glover also sexually violated her, although it is not known if she was alive when he did this. He denied raping her. Police found him in Joan's bathtub.  He had overdosed on tablets and wrote a suicide note with the words *no more grannies*. He pleaded not guilty due to diminished responsibility but he was convicted. During the trial it emerged he had a poker machine addiction and the easiest way to feed his habit was to bash and rob elderly women. He was sentenced to consecutive life terms and killed himself in 2005. NOTE: The RED HEART Campaign is seeking photos of Joan Sinclair, Emmie May Anderson, Elsie Boyes and Christina Yankos.

He then stabbed her to death, later telling the police the little girl was not *dying fast enough*. Hadlow wrapped Sandra in a corn sack and hid her in the boot of a car. He then joined the local community in searching for her. When police eventually arrested him he said: *Yes, I've killed her. I've been expecting you to pick me up*. He served 23 years in jail and was paroled in 1985. Not long after his parole he married divorced mother-of-eight Leonie Rose Moody, whom he met in Toowoomba. The pair lived on the Darling Downs for some years before moving to Roma. In 1990, he abducted, raped and murdered nine-year-old Stacey-Ann Tracy. Hadlow grabbed Stacey-Ann on her way to school, sexually assaulted and killed her, dumped her body near a creek and then returned home like nothing had happened. Just as he did after he murdered Sandra, Hadlow took part in the search for Stacey-Ann when news emerged of her disappearance. He was arrested after evidence linking him to Stacey-Ann's body was found. He pleaded not guilty to murder but a jury disagreed.

No one has been charged with Elsie's murder but it is believed she was a victim of John Wayne Glover who murdered at least six other women. Glover was convicted of the murders of Muriel Falconer, Joan Sinclair, Margaret Pahud, Olive Cleveland, Gwendolin Mitchelhill and Winfreda Ashton. It is also suspected that he killed Wanda Amundsen (November 21, 1986), Emmie May Anderson, 78, in East Melbourne (October 19, 1961); Irene Kiddle, 61, St Kilda (March 22, 1963); Christina Yankos, 63, Albert Park (April 9, 1968); Florence Broadhurst, 78, Paddington (October 15, 1977); and Josephine McDonald, 72, Ettalong (August 29, 1984). Glover came to police attention not long before he killed Joan Sinclair, after he molested an elderly patient at a hospital. Medical staff called police. Officers tracked him down and a few weeks later left him a note requesting he come in to see them.  He was under police surveillance when he went to Joan's home. Around three hours later officers realised there was no movement. Six hours later they entered the property to find Joan dead. Her head had been beaten with a hammer and her clothing was wrapped around her neck. Glover also sexually violated her, although it is not known if she was alive when he did this. He denied raping her. Police found him in Joan's bathtub.  He had overdosed on tablets and wrote a suicide note with the words *no more grannies*. He survived, and pleaded not guilty due to diminished responsibility but he was convicted. During the trial it emerged he had a poker machine addiction and the easiest way to feed his habit was to bash and rob elderly women. He was sentenced to consecutive life terms and killed himself in 2005. * NOTE: The RED HEART Campaign is seeking photos of Joan Sinclair, Emmie May Anderson, Elsie Boyes and Christina Yankos.
