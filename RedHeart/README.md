# RedHeart

## Data
Contains a downloaded html static version of the RedHeart database website. Generated csvs from the scrape are also put here.

## Jupyter Notebooks
Generated Jupyter notebooks and their respective html variants are stored here. `notebook` contains details on the entire process from scraping to cleaning to visualizing data, while `plot_data` files contain information only on visualizing the data found.

## Python Scripts
Self explanatory scripts for the data collection and plot generation process. `gen_sources_wordcloud.py` currently not working as most websites are paywalled, preventing scraping from working. `gen_stores_wordcloud.py` generates a wordcloud that can be found in `Wordclouds` using the `story` data column.

## Wordclouds
Contains one generated wordclouding using the `story` data column.
