She yelled at the offender to not touch her and also cried out for help. Dozens of volunteers – many close friends - helped search for her. Shanae’s body was found in an area where a male is said to have assaulted multiple woman. Shanae was a seasoned traveller who spent many years volunteering with children. She was teaching English in Tbilisi and planned to remain there for some time, having fallen in love with the region that is close to Russia. *She absolutely admired the charm of old Georgian houses that you can find somewhere in the villages,* Shanae’s friend Lina Khamatova said. *She was talking about how awesome it would be to live in a Georgian village somewhere, where nature is lush, birds are chirping and not many people around. She enjoyed people’s company, having lunches with friends. Lately she was into flora, she was learning the names of Georgian flora. She also loved animals. She said she ‘was adopted by a cat’ which she let into her apartment to give birth to four kittens. She had two teaching jobs online and offline, but she stayed up all night taking care of the newborn kittens and their mum. She would also be respectful and supportive of her friends and students. She had the best personality anyone can ever have. You could have fun together, or just be quiet, or have the best conversations about life with her. She was very strong, she had many good habits - waking up before 5am or hiking up the hill routinely. I feel every day even more pain of losing her, knowing that it’s impossible to see her again, realising how hard it is to meet people like Shanae.* Russian media reported the murderer would only serve seven to 15 years in jail if convicted.

He attacked Gihan shortly after she finished her shift at the hospital and instead of taking her to the emergency department, he allowed her to bleed out in the street.

He killed Gihan after months of ongoing volatile and controlling behaviour where he constantly accused her of cheating, monitored her phone, took away her car keys, installed a GPS device in her car and tracked her movements. Despite all of this Kerollos was found not guilty due to mental illness because forensic psychiatrists said he was suffering delusional beliefs. Gihan’s son Paul said in his victim impact statement: *I lost my mum and my dad at the same time. I keep asking myself, is there anything we could have done to prevent this?

Robertson controlled Katie movements, questioned her movements, placed her under surveillance and constantly called and texted her, even when she was working. *Last night an act of pure evil touched our family,* Katie’s family said in a statement to media after Katie was killed. *She did not deserve what happened to her. Our beautiful Katie girl, not only did we lose a much-loved daughter and sister, but two precious children lost their beautiful mother.*   Robertson pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to 24 years in jail with parole after 19 years.

Toyah had taken her dog to the beach for a walk but failed to return home. She was reported missing and her body was found the following day. Her dog was tied up nearby.  Media reports said Toyah suffered significant injuries during the assault.   Toyah’s friend Megan Amour wrote this letter to her mate: *Dear Toyah, It was not that long ago we were going through my photos of us and you asked me to put them on your USB when you came over next. We didn’t get the chance and I just feel that everyone deserves to see the most amazing memories we created in what I would call not long enough 5-minute film. I don’t know what people have been expecting me to say in conjunction of what happened today but I don’t want to talk to everyone, I want to talk to you. I can’t believe this, I refuse to believe this. Would you believe that I have over 30+ messages in my inbox all unread, not because I’m popular but because you have touched so many souls including mine and we are all in that much pain that making sure those who were closest to you are OK. I wish you were here to talk to them and tell them you are OK. I wanted to be like you, I wanted to be the gypsy soul you were. I wanted to be flawless and not just the beauty you had on the outside but the beauty you had on the inside. You were different to everyone, you followed what you believed in, you had nobody hating you. You lived life to the fullest and you respected everyone else’s decisions. You had such a big heart and a beautiful loving family you adored. It wasn’t that long ago, I pulled up with a bouquet of balloons and a box full of goodies asking you to stand by my side while I marry the man I love and you were so willingly accepted and it took you less than a minute to start planning everything with me. I started to feel like I can’t get married anymore, because you won’t be there, you won’t be there standing with me and witnessing this milestone of my life. You will be there somehow, I will make sure of it, you love memory will be shared everyday for as long as I live, I will be sharing the funny, loving, crazy memories about aunty TOYTOY to Rose when she’s older and tell her that she would have loved you the way I did. I’m betting you’re going to be the most prettiest angel up there with the most prettiest wings, and over a thousand of puppy angels surrounding you. Look over us, and shine bright my honey, there will not be a day where I don’t think of you because believe me every single day is going to hurt, I love you.* Toyah’s killer has not been found.

In April of 2019, he was sentenced to nine years in jail with parole after six years because the sentencing judge could not determine how Karen died and if her death was deliberate.

She went to hospital and even though she was scared for her life, she gave police a statement. The hospital discharged her, with doctors failing to find that her spleen had ruptured. In agony, she begged her neighbour and her partner&#39;s mother for help to call an ambulance, but an ambulance was refused. She had no money for a taxi and she was unable to get to hospital. She ultimately bled to death, alone on the cold bathroom floor.  Turner was sentenced to 12 years in jail for manslaughter. He must serve nine years and is due for parole in June, 2026. A coronial inquest will investigate the ambulance and hospital failings.

In 2020, a coroner found the police investigation was highly inadequate and that Cheralyn’s death should be re-investigated due to the likelihood that she was killed by another person. The coroner also investigated the apparent suicides of Layla (Gulum) Leering, 15, and Fionica James, 17. Layla died at Bulla in 2017 and Fionica died at Maningrida in the same year. While the coroner found both Layla and Fionica were subjected to violence before they died, it was most likely that they ended their own lives.  No one has been charged over Cheralyn’s death.

He stabbed her and he broke multiple bones in her body. On the day he murdered Kwementyaye, community members heard her screaming but no one came to help. Witnesses said they did not intervene because Stevenson *beating up* Kwementyaye was commonplace and that she was always *busted up*. Stevenson told police he assaulted Kwementyaye repeatedly in the face with his fists, his feet and a stick. He said she was *bleeding like full mad* during the five-hour assault that resulted in her death. He also jumped on her face four times and punched her in the stomach, before leaving her to die.  He killed Kwementyaye because she did not want to go home with him. Stevenson was sentenced to 14 years in prison with parole after eight years. He is due for release in 2023. *The woman who saw you dragging Kwementyaye and stomping on her stomach didn&#39;t try to help Kwementyaye, she didn&#39;t try to stop you and she did not call the police,* the sentencing judge said.  *No-one tried to stop him and no-one called the police.

Her partner Rodney Shannon was found next to Kwementyaye&#39;s body in a vacant lot. Police took Shannon in for questioning but failed to secure the crime scene, destroyed forensic evidence and persisted with the idea that Kwementyaye stabbed herself to death. Shannon was released without charge, giving him the opportunity to return to the place where Kwementyaye died to remove any evidence that might have been left. A coronial inquest in June of 2016 found the police investigation was of *poor quality* and that there were many failures that went unrecognised by senior police. Kwementyaye&#39;s parents Louise Rankine and Casper Green have been lobbying for a long time to have their daughter&#39;s death properly investigated and Shannon charged. The  NT Director of Public Prosecutions said it was unlikely Shannon would be charged due a lack of evidence. *How can you apologise to us again for the third time? He (the police) should apologise only once,* Louise told a media outlet after the inquest. *I see them (the police) walking around, and I think to myself, they are walking alive.

After raping and murdering Jill, he left her body near Gisborne South. Jill&#39;s disappearance from the popular inner-city street and her terrifying last moments scared women across Australia, with tens of thousands of people taking to the streets to show their outrage at the system that released Bayley as well as showing their support for Jill&#39;s family. In 2016, the Victorian coroner ruled Jill would still be alive if parole and bail laws were more stringent.  Bayley was sentenced to life with a 35-year non-parole period.  His appeal was rejected and in 2015, Bayley was sentenced to another 18 years and his non-parole period was extended to 43 years for three more rapes. In July 2016, the sentence was reduced to 40 years, deducting three years off the term. Bayley is now eligible for parole in 2055. In total, Bayley has been convicted of sexual crimes against 12 people. *I hated him [Bayley] obviously and I still do,* Jill&#39;s husband Tom Meagher wrote on the White Ribbon website following Bayley&#39;s sentencing. *I would have to have some sort of religious experience to get to a point where I don&#39;t.

I have been shocked to the core of my being. I feel battered and bruised as a mother, never whole again without her. I can no longer live an ordinary life and my heart suffers from the deepest wound from which it will never recover. I was her mother for almost 30 years and she was taken so suddenly from my life. The impact of Gillian&#39;s murder has been catastrophic. The loneliness and sadness I feel is enormous. I never realised how much I was thinking of her until she was so cruelly taken. Ordinary things like shopping, I would look at something and automatically think that it would suit Gillian. The emotional impact is huge. I suffer from insomnia, anxiety, panic attacks and I now look at the world so differently.

Hall also hit Brooke&#39;s brothers Marc and Wayne and her partner as he deliberately drove into them at 60-80km/h while drunk. The hit and run attack was revenge for having a disagreement with Marc. When Brooke realised Hall was going to attack Marc with the car, she shielded him and the others. Hall was charged with murder, attempted murder, driving causing grievous bodily harm, driving under the influence and failing to stop after an accident. *I suppose it was out of anger just &#39;cause I had the shit kicked out of me and I just wanted to get &#39;em back, I suppose,&#39;&#39; Hall said.   A jury convicted him of Brooke&#39;s murder, two counts of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent and one of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.  He was acquitted of attempted murder. He was sentenced to 20 years in jail with parole after 14 years. He was due for release in December of 2013. It is not known where he is now.  *It spoils our Christmas every year, it&#39;s just not the same, it brings back memories,&#39;&#39; Brooke&#39;s mother Carol said after Hall&#39;s trial. *I drove her down there that night. She rang me 10 minutes before all this happened telling me she was having a great time, she loved me and not to go to sleep because I had to pick her up. The next phone call I got was about 40 minutes after that; it was Brooke&#39;s friend David.

Joy experienced ongoing abuse at the hands of Mulhall including an attack eight months before she died where he strangled her while she was asleep. He also bashed her, causing severe injuries to her shoulder and bruising across her torso and face. He was charged with that assault, released on bail and placed on an intervention order preventing him from having any contact with Joy. By October, Joy had resumed her relationship with Mulhall. Eleven days later he strangled Joy with a tie and then his hands before putting a pillowcase over her face so he would not have to look at her as she died. After killing Joy, Mulhall stole money from her bank account and went on a gambling spree for several days. Mulhall was sentenced to 19 years in prison with parole after 16 years. He is due for release in 2030.  An inquest into Joy&#39;s death found her murder could have been prevented but systematic police failures meant Mulhall was able to attack Joy over and over again. Following the inquest, the Victorian police commissioner issued a public apology to her family conceding his officers had failed to do their job. *We are relieved to hear it is acknowledged our mother was left unprotected but are extremely sad to know that after surviving a serious near-death attack, our mother had a second chance at life which was passed by because of numerous police failures,* Joy&#39;s daughter Renee Woolridge told media outlets after the inquest. *Our concerns were validated when we heard police policies and procedures were not followed and there were no consequences for the lack of adherence.

Pickett killed Andrea, who had 13 children, while he was on parole. He was also the subject of a violence restraining order. Four days before she died, Andrea reported to police that Pickett had breached the violence restraining order after finding 30 pages of letters written by Pickett and discovering a machete in her daughter&#39;s room. Two days before her death, Andrea&#39;s niece called 000 after Pickett pulled a knife on Andrea. The day before she died, Andrea approached a crisis care provider for urgent accommodation but was rejected because there was not enough room for and the seven children she was caring for. She arranged to stay at her cousin&#39;s home where she thought she would be safe, but Pickett broke in. Andrea escaped onto the road where Pickett stabbed her to death. Her body remained in the road for 15 hours. A coronial inquest found Andrea was let down by the parole system that failed to provide adequate supervision to ensure Pickett was unable to contact Andrea. WA State Coroner Alastair Hope said Pickett should have been traced with GPS monitoring. He said Andrea&#39;s death also revealed deficiencies in the communication between the Department of Corrective Services and WA Police. Andrea&#39;s brother Gary Bentley said there was no doubt Andrea would still be alive if the parole and police systems had adequate plans in place for domestic violence victims. *I think there needs to be a lot more emphasis put on housing for women in domestic violence, or running from domestic violence,* he told reporters. *The response that was given to Andrea was severely lacking and I think that was identified on a number of occasions throughout the inquest and I hope that there is some peace in the mind of those in the Corrective Services, who allowed him out in the first place. I hope there&#39;s some peace in the mind of the police, who failed at the time to protect Andrea, and I hope that other women in the same situation will get the support they need.* Pickett was sentenced to 20 years in jail.

Ryan was found not guilty due to mental illness and he spent the next 12 years in Long Bay Forensic Hospital and Cumberland Hospital. Ryan died on February 28, 2019. *Mum was a lab assistant in the science department at Caringbah High School,* Hazel&#39;s son told The RED HEART Campaign. *She was very well known and liked by many. She had been there 33 years at time of her death. The school were very supportive and dedicated the upgraded science classrooms to her -  a  plaque is on the wall. Mum was cremated and her ashes were buried at Henry Kendall Rose Garden at Woronora Cemetery, Sutherland. She left behind two sons. She never got to see her grand-daughter who was born just one month after she was murdered.*" data-source1="https://www.smh.com.au/national/accused-murderer-halfnaked-in-court-20071101-17ce.html" data-source2=""><img id="lazy-img" src="./Database _ The RED HEART Campaign_files/Red-Heart_Adult.png" alt=""><span class="tooltiptext">Hazel Mcloon, 68.

After finding Kieffen, police ruled he had drowned by accident and did not investigate any further. A coronial inquest was held with the coroner ruling there was not enough evidence to say Kieffen&#39;s death was accidental and it was quite likely he was murdered. This included the fact that Kieffen was unlikely to wander off, he was afraid of water, he had lacerations that were most likely inflicted on him by another person and because there were two large rocks in his shorts.

Linda had decided to end the marriage. Throughout his trial, Baxter claimed this caused him to have a mental breakdown and to kill Linda. Earlier in the day he told friends *I should kill her*. Hours later he stabbed Linda 30 times in the face, back, chest, shoulder, arms and hands before leaving her body in the family home and running away with the children. Baxter&#39;s insanity plea was rejected and he was sentenced to 20 years in jail with parole after 16 years.

During a coronial inquest, it was found that police failures contributed to Anne&#39;s death. These included decisions not to investigate and prosecute Green for at least five severe DVO breaches including one just days before Anne was killed. *The death of the deceased at 3.44am on Friday 28 March 2003, may well have been a preventable death,* the coroner said. *It is not to the point that the relationship between the deceased and her boyfriend was one that, if it continued into the future, might have resulted in the bashing that brought about the deceased&#39;s death. The death of the deceased at the hand of Green was not inevitable. The powers given to police to enforce noncontact DVOs are designed to ensure that the person in relation to whom the order is made is protected; and where the order is breached, that protection extends to the removal of the offender so that further violence cannot be perpetrated upon the victim.* NOTE: If you can supply more information about this victim or a photo, please contact Sherele Moody via The RED HEART Campaign or Australian Femicide Map Facebook pages.

He claimed he killed Julie because she did not want to be in a relationship with him and she was not interested in having sex. Ramage was charged with murder but was convicted of manslaughter on the basis of provocation.  He was sentenced to 11 years in jail with parole after eight. He was released in 2011. As a result of this inadequate sentencing, Victoria quashed the defence of provocation. Ramage has since returned to run the business Julie part-owned and has re-partnered.

However, that conviction was over-turned on appeal because the evidence relied on at trial was inconclusive and there was enough evidence to suggest someone else had murdered her. No one else has been charged over Tarmara&#39;s death.

Police found Valerie&#39;s body in the boat and when they asked him what happened he said he hit something in the dark and *she fell out the front*.

After murdering Kira, Cherry dumped her body in an unknown location. Cherry had been sexually abusing Kira over the past few years and ended her life because he feared she would tell police about the abuse and the fact that he had forced her big sister Debbie Guise to kill their mother - Cherry&#39;s wife - Annette Cherry (Guise). Debbie Guise was convicted on a charge of manslaughter over her mother&#39;s death and served five years in jail. She was released in 2001 when she helped police collect evidence showing Cherry had forced her to kill her mother. Cherry was sentenced to life in prison for both killings with parole after serving 20 years. He was due for release in 2018 but remained behind bars under Queensland&#39;s no body, no parole laws.

I would always grab my sister to help her out, by finding a really good place. We were a great team. We were so alike in features that everyone knew we were brother and sister. We shared a special bond, like twins. I was little bossy with her at times or jealous, but that&#39;s just natural I guess. Mostly I was very protective and always looked out for Lauren.* Camilleri also killed 13-year-old Prue Bird.

Sarah disappeared a few months before 23-year-old Jane Rimmer was murdered.  Jane was last seen in the same area as Sarah. Ciara Glennon disappeared from Claremont about 14 months after Sarah went missing. Sarah, Ciara and Jane were suspected of being murdered by Bradley Robert Edwards. In 2016. Edwards was charged with their murders and in October of 2020 he was convicted over the killing of Ciara and Jane.  Edwards - during a judge only trial - was acquitted of the murder of Sarah. The trial judge said while he believed Edwards killed Sarah there simply was not enough evidence to convict him of her murder. *Sarah was really cool. She was just a beautiful person. I remember always thinking I really hope she likes me, just because she was such a lovely girl. She was really funny and very dry with her humour,* Sarah&#39;s friend Brodie Hudson told a media outlet in December, 2016.  Edwards is yet to be sentenced (October, 2020).

Parry and McLauchlan were British nurses and colleagues of Yvonne.

Both women were released from jail after they were pardoned and returned to the UK. McLauchlan died in 2014.

He went to the Higgins* home to steal Paul&#39;s Porsche, believing Paul would not be home. He convinced Paul to let him in and after they argued over the relationship, Lewis used a diving knife to repeatedly stab Paul. Carmel came home shortly after. He decided to kill Carmel because he knew she would be able to identify him. He then wrapped their bodies in a tarpaulin and buried them in the backyard before fleeing in the Porsche. He also took credit cars and money and headed to the Gold Coast where he partied with the stolen money. He was captured six days later and charged with two counts of murder. He blamed Paul and Carmel&#39;s daughter for the killings and as a result of his defence taking this path, he went to trial five times. Two trials were aborted, two ended with hung juries and the final one saw him convicted. Lewis was sentenced to 26 years in jail and he is due for release in 2021 and will likely be deported. *He just had no remorse, it was almost like a big joke to him,* Carmel and Paul&#39;s son Paul Junior told a media outlet in 2017. *I remember him sitting at the back of the court sneering.

During the police investigation, officers found Keogh had taken out five insurance policies on Anna-Jane&#39;s life. A forensic expert told the court Anna-jane had bruising on her legs consistent with someone holding her down.  However, the conviction was over-turned on appeal in 2014, due to flawed forensic evidence.

If she was still alive when she reached the bottom of the shaft, she was given no chance of survival once she was buried.* Alavija was sentenced to life in prison with parole after 20 years. He was due for release in 2013 with expectations that he would be deported.

Ashfield led a sustained and brutal attack on the little boy because she felt he touched his sister *inappropriately*. During the assault she encouraged John&#39;s siblings to take part and it ended with Ashfield putting a telephone book against his head and hitting it with a hammer.

Hughes was released but returned to prison in 2012 for breaching the Child protection Act. He is now free.

The killer used a chord to kill Annette and she also had head injuries. In 2007, the Victorian Coroner named her colleague Craig Cameron Rogers as the sole suspect in her murder. Annette had told fellow workers she was angry and had argued with Rogers who broke into her house about a week earlier. Annette also told family and friends she was being sexually harassed by a co-worker.  Rogers was interviewed by detectives several times and he gave a number of *false denials*, the coroner said.  *But they established that he was far more involved with the deceased than he had previously led police to believe,* the coroner said. No one has been charged over Annette&#39;s murder. *Every day and every year my brother and I have missed out on special times but the hardest thing now is explaining to her grandchildren why she is not here. She has missed out on seeing her grandchildren, weddings, we should be sharing all that,* Annette&#39;s daughter Jacinta Martin told media in 2015. Darren John Chalmers, 52, has also been named as a suspect in Annette&#39;s death. He was convicted of the 2019 murder of Dianne Barrett in Western Australia.

He pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter on mental health grounds because he was *stressed over custody issues and the end of their marriage*. However, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to 16 years in jail with parole after 10 years. He appealed, and the conviction was thrown out. He was again convicted of murder and again sentenced to 16 years with parole after 10. He was due for release in 2003 and it is not known where he is now. *There was so much intent, so much premeditation,* Marilyn&#39;s sister Gail Caruana told media outside of court during his first trial." data-source1="" data-source2=""><img id="lazy-img" src="./Database _ The RED HEART Campaign_files/Red-Heart_Adult.png" alt=""><span class="tooltiptext">Marilyn Maxwell, 37.

Clinton&#39;s family and the Bowraville community, along with police, believe Clinton&#39;s murder is related to the killing of four-year-old Evelyn Greenup and the disappearance of 16-year-old Colleen Walker.  Evelyn, Clinton and Colleen disappeared over a five-month period from houses on the same street following parties. A man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was acquitted of Evelyn and Clinton&#39;s murders at separate trials in 1997 and 2006. That same man has been re-charged over Evelyn and Clinton&#39;s deaths. The families of Evelyn, Clinton and Colleen spent 25 years lobbying to have the three cases heard together. However, NSW&#39;s double jeopardy laws need to be circumvented for this to happen. The NSW Attorney-General has submitted an application to the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal to have the man face trial again.

Joan was one of six women killed by Glover over 14 months in 1989-1990. Glover also murdered Margaret Pahud, Gwendolin Mitchelhill, Muriel Falconer, Olive Cleveland and Winifreda Ashton. Glover came to police attention not long before he killed Joan, after he molested an elderly patient at a hospital. Medical staff called police. Officers tracked him down and a few weeks later left him a note requesting he come in to see them.  He was under police surveillance when he went to Joan&#39;s home. Around three hours later officers realised there was no movement. Six hours later they entered the property to find Joan dead. Her head had been beaten with a hammer and her clothing was wrapped around her neck. Glover also sexually violated her, although it is not known if she was alive when he did this. He denied raping her. Police found him in Joan&#39;s bathtub.  He had overdosed on tablets and wrote a suicide note with the words *no more grannies*. He pleaded not guilty due to diminished responsibility but he was convicted. During the trial it emerged he had a poker machine addiction and the easiest way to feed his habit was to bash and rob elderly women. He was sentenced to consecutive life terms and killed himself in 2005.  Police believe Glover may have also murdered Emmie May Anderson, 78, in East Melbourne (October 19, 1961); Irene Kiddle, 61, St Kilda (March 22, 1963); Elsie Boyes, 68, St Kilda (1967); Christina Yankos, 63, Albert Park (April 9, 1968); Florence Broadhurst, 78, Paddington (October 15, 1977); Josephine McDonald, 72, Ettalong (August 29, 1984); and Wanda Amundsen, 83, Umina (November 21, 1986).

Evelyn&#39;s family and the Bowraville community, along with police, believe Evelyn&#39;s murder is related to the killing of 16-year-old Clinton Speedy-Duroux and the disappearance of 16-year-old Colleen Walker.  Evelyn, Clinton and Colleen disappeared over a five-month period from houses on the same street following parties.

Gwendolin was the first of six women killed by Glover over 14 months in 1989-1990. Glover also murdered Joan Sinclair, Margaret Pahud, Olive Cleveland, Muriel Falconer and Winifreda Ashton (see separate entries). Glover followed Gwendolin to her home and as she entered the front door he hit her across the head with a hammer. He then bashed her around the torso and head, breaking her ribs. Glover stole $100 from Gwendolin&#39;s purse. Gwendolin was found by a couple of children. She was still alive but died by the time the ambulance arrived. Glover came to police attention in 1990 after he molested an elderly patient at a hospital. Medical staff called police. Officers tracked him down and a few weeks later left him a note requesting he come in to see them. He took an overdose of tablets and wrote a suicide note with the words *no more grannies*. The information was passed to police investigating the so called granny killings and Glover was arrested. He pleaded not guilty due to diminished responsibility but he was convicted.

He was arrested hours later immigration charges because, during the trial, it emerged he had another wife as well as two children. His hidden family was not disclosed on visa documents. He was eventually convicted of perjury and ordered to serve 14 years, but that was overturned on appeal. It is not known where Zarw is now. No one else has been convicted of murdering Tracey-Anne.

John Travers, Michael Murdoch and brothers Michael, Gary and Les Murphy grabbed Anita as she was walking from a train station in Blacktown, Sydney. The men bashed her then forced her to perform sex acts on them once they had her in their car. They used her money to fuel the vehicle before driving her to a secluded paddock where they raped and bashed her multiple times. Travers then slit her throat because he was worried she could identify him and the others. Anita&#39;s body was found in the paddock two days after she was killed. All of the men were arrested and charged within 22 days of Anita&#39;s death. On June 10, 1987, all five killers were found guilty of sexual assault and murder. They were all sentenced to life in jail and their files were marked never to be released. *This was one of the most horrifying physical and sexual assaults,* Justice Alan Maxwell said during their sentencing. *This was a calculated killing done in cold blood.* Anita&#39;s parents Garry and Grace Lynch started the Homicide Victims&#39; Support Group in memory of their daughter. They also successfully campaigned for tougher sentencing laws. A park in Blacktown was named the Anita Cobby Reserve. Garry and Grace have both passed away. Anita&#39;s little sister Kathryn Szyszka told a media outlet in 2015: *I do wonder sometimes what my life would be like today if I had my sister here with me. I imagine she would have gone on to have children. We&#39;d be no doubt sharing time together, and the cousins would be our bond as sisters and we would have continued doing things together.

The judge even portioned blamed on Jacqueline, claiming she *raised some of your basic instincts* and that resulted in her death. Hunter was jailed for 16 years but only served 13.

Glover was convicted of the murders of Muriel Falconer, Joan Sinclair, Margaret Pahud, Olive Cleveland, Gwendolin Mitchelhill and Winfreda Ashton. It is also suspected that he killed Emmie May Anderson, 78, in East Melbourne (October 19, 1961); Irene Kiddle, 61, St Kilda (March 22, 1963); Elsie Boyes, 63, Prahran (June 3, 1967); Christina Yankos, 63, Albert Park (April 9, 1968); Florence Broadhurst, 78, Paddington (October 16, 1977); and Josephine McDonald, 72, Ettalong (August 29, 1984). Glover came to police attention in 1990 after he molested an elderly patient at a hospital. Medical staff called police. Officers tracked him down and a few weeks later left him a note requesting he come in to see them. He took an overdose of tablets and wrote a suicide note with the words *no more grannies*. The information was passed to police investigating the so called granny killings and Glover was arrested. He pleaded not guilty due to diminished responsibility but he was convicted. During the trial it emerged he had a poker machine addiction and the easiest way to feed his habit was to bash and rob elderly women. He was sentenced to consecutive life terms and killed himself in 2005. If you know anything please contact CrimeStoppers on  www.crimestoppers.com.au or call 1800 333 000.

McDonald hired three men to help him abduct Marlene who had survived ongoing violence during her relationship. Her car was found at her workplace and she was reported missing by her employer the next day. Police failed to investigate Marlene&#39;s disappearance properly, marking her down only as a missing person. In 2007, police relooked at Marlene&#39;s case and found a fingerprint connecting McDonald to one of the kidnappers, Gregory Bone. Also charged with Marlene&#39;s kidnapping was Stuart Binion and a 41-year-old Moe man. In April, 2011, McDonald was convicted of Marlene&#39;s murder. He was also found to have stalked Marlene relentlessly, subjected her to abuse and after she disappeared, McDonald set about destroying the good memories the children had of their mum. *Quite understandably, they do not believe that you have poisoned their minds; but there was much evidence before the court that you are an accomplished liar and a manipulator of others,* Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth said. *And over the many years since her death, you told the children a series of lies about Marlene, including perhaps the most terrible lie of all - that their mother had simply run away and abandoned them, for her own selfish reasons, when you knew full well that you had murdered her.* During his sentencing, Marlene&#39;s daughters read victim impact statements that painted their mother as a moody drug user who had abandoned them. They all claimed their father was innocent. *My mother never showed any motherly interest and paid no interest in us at all. I truly believe I have missed out on a mother daughter bond because she wasn&#39;t prepared to give the time or develop it,* one of the children said. *In my eyes my dad is my knight in shining armour, he is my rock, my solid rock of comfort. His arms are where I have felt most comfort and have been a safe haven for my siblings and myself.* McDonald was sentenced to 19 years in jail with parole after 13 years. He is eligible for release in 2024. He appealed the conviction but it was thrown out. Marlene&#39;s body has not been found.

It is also suspected that he killed Emmie May Anderson, 78, in East Melbourne (October 19, 1961); Irene Kiddle, 61, St Kilda (March 22, 1963); Elsie Boyes, 63, Prahran (June 3, 1967); Christina Yankos, 63, Albert Park (April 9, 1968); Florence Broadhurst, 78, Paddington (October 16, 1977); and Wanda Amundsen, 83, Umina (November 21, 1986).  Glover came to police attention in 1990 after he molested an elderly patient at a hospital. Medical staff called police. Officers tracked him down and a few weeks later left him a note requesting he come in to see them. He took an overdose of tablets and wrote a suicide note with the words *no more grannies*. The information was passed to police investigating the so called granny killings and Glover was arrested. He pleaded not guilty due to diminished responsibility but he was convicted. During the trial it emerged he had a poker machine addiction and the easiest way to feed his habit was to bash and rob elderly women. He was sentenced to consecutive life terms and killed himself in 2005. * NOTE: The RED HEART Campaign is seeking photos of Joan Sinclair,  Emmie May Anderson,  Elsie Boyes, Christina Yankos and  Florence Broadhurst.

Jill had left Bayne six weeks earlier. He lured Jill to his house by saying their 17-year-old son had run away. Bayne had kicked the teenager out and Jill had no idea. She came to the property intending on helping Bayne find their son. When she arrived, Bayne gave her a letter that he had penned. As she was reading the letter, he shot her in the wrist. When Jill fell to the floor, Bayne put his foot on her head and fired the rifle into her ear, in each eye and then he shot her twice in the head. Bayne had abused Jill throughout their 18-year marriage and he continued the abuse after she left him. The abuse including not allowing her to get a job or take part in classes or social events, he isolated her from friends and family and refused to let her have another child, going so far as to force her to take the pill each night. Jill&#39;s sister spoke about the abuse in the book Blood on Whose Hands. *I talked her into it (going out one night),* she said. *We stayed for too long and I got lost driving back. When she tried to open the door with her key it wouldn&#39;t work. Keith had put the deadlock on. So we knocked on the door. Keith opened it and said &#39;the shit gets delivered through the back door&#39; and slammed the door in our faces.* After killing Jill, Bayne shot himself. However, he survived. Bayne was convicted of Jill&#39;s murder and was sentenced to life in prison. He was due for release in 2008. It is not known where he is now.

Patricia&#39;s partner Kelvin Ronald Condren was charged with Patricia&#39;s murder and eventually convicted. Both Patricia and Kelvin are Indigenous. On June 26, 1990 the Court of Criminal Appeal set aside the conviction and a retrial was ordered. The charge of murder was withdrawn after a number of witnesses came forward to say they saw Patricia alive hours after police claim she was found. Seven weeks after Patricia died, Andy Albury killed Indigenous woman Gloria Pindar in Darwin. During the investigation into Gloria&#39;s death, Albury, a Caucasian man, told Northern Territory police he killed *a black g.. in Mt Isa at the end of September, 1983. He described the murder weapon and the clothes Patricia was wearing, explained he repeatedly hit her around the head and that he put a rock inside of her body. He also made the same confession to a doctor. He later withdrew the confessions. Albury was sentenced to life in prison for Gloria&#39;s murder and declared a dangerous prisoner who should never be released. Albury has not been charged with Patricia&#39;s murder.

You think, &#39;I won&#39;t say anything because it might upset so-and-so.&#39; So you say nothing at all. And after a while it gets harder and harder to talk about mum and the kids.* " data-source1="https://www.smh.com.au/national/a-never-ending-crime-20080301-gds39t.html" data-source2=""><img id="lazy-img" src="./Database _ The RED HEART Campaign_files/Red-Heart_Child.png" alt=""><span class="tooltiptext">Damien Connell, 4.

Glover came to police attention not long before he killed Joan Sinclair, after he molested an elderly patient at a hospital. Medical staff called police. Officers tracked him down and a few weeks later left him a note requesting he come in to see them.  He was under police surveillance when he went to Joan&#39;s home. Around three hours later officers realised there was no movement. Six hours later they entered the property to find Joan dead. Her head had been beaten with a hammer and her clothing was wrapped around her neck. Glover also sexually violated her, although it is not known if she was alive when he did this. He denied raping her. Police found him in Joan&#39;s bathtub.  He had overdosed on tablets and wrote a suicide note with the words *no more grannies*. He pleaded not guilty due to diminished responsibility but he was convicted. During the trial it emerged he had a poker machine addiction and the easiest way to feed his habit was to bash and rob elderly women. He was sentenced to consecutive life terms and killed himself in 2005. NOTE: The RED HEART Campaign is seeking photos of Joan Sinclair, Emmie May Anderson, Elsie Boyes and Christina Yankos.

He killed Francesco and left his body at the bottom of a cliff in Victoria. Cameron was caught and convicted for murdering Florence. He was sentenced to just nine years in jail and on his release in 1983, he was extradited to Victoria to where he was tried and convicted for the murder of Francesco. He was released in 1990 after authorities decided he was fully rehabilitated. He had served less than 16 years for both murders. In March, 1990 Cameron bashed and strangled to death 44-year-old Maria Goellner. He met Maria through a Melbourne radio station&#39;s match-making competition. He left flowers on Maria&#39;s body. He was sentenced to life in prison for Maria&#39;s murder.  In November, 1997, Cameron told police he murdered war widow Sarah McKenzie at her home in Milsons Point, New South Wales. He killed Sarah while on the run for the murders of Florence and Francesco. Cameron is expected to die in jail. NOTE: The RED HEART Campaign is seeking a photo of Florence.

As a mature woman I am not asking for pity, I am asking for justice to be served.* If you know anything please contact CrimeStoppers on  www.crimestoppers.com.au or call 1800 333 000.

No one has been charged with Christina&#39;s murder but it is believed she was a victim of John Wayne Glover who murdered at least six other women. Glover was convicted of the murders of Muriel Falconer, Joan Sinclair, Margaret Pahud, Olive Cleveland, Gwendolin Mitchelhill and WinIfreda Ashton. It is also suspected that he killed Wanda Amundsen (November 21, 1986); Emmie May Anderson, 78, East Melbourne (October 19, 1961); Irene Kiddle, 61, St Kilda (March 22, 1963); Elsie Boyes, 68, St Kilda (1967); Florence Broadhurst, 78, Paddington (October 15, 1977); and Josephine McDonald, 72, Ettalong (August 29, 1984). Glover came to police attention not long before he killed Joan Sinclair, after he molested an elderly patient at a hospital. Medical staff called police. Officers tracked him down and a few weeks later left him a note requesting he come in to see them.  He was under police surveillance when he went to Joan&#39;s home. Around three hours later officers realised there was no movement. Six hours later they entered the property to find Joan dead. Her head had been beaten with a hammer and her clothing was wrapped around her neck. Glover also sexually violated her, although it is not known if she was alive when he did this. He denied raping her. Police found him in Joan&#39;s bathtub.  He had overdosed on tablets and wrote a suicide note with the words *no more grannies*. He pleaded not guilty due to diminished responsibility but he was convicted. During the trial it emerged he had a poker machine addiction and the easiest way to feed his habit was to bash and rob elderly women. He was sentenced to consecutive life terms and killed himself in 2005. NOTE: The RED HEART Campaign is seeking photos of Joan Sinclair, Emmie May Anderson, Elsie Boyes and Christina Yankos.

Hadlow lured Sandra into his house with the offer of showing her some books. It is unclear if he raped Sandra, but when he tried to remove her clothes she screamed and he choked her. He then stabbed her to death, later telling the police the little girl was not *dying fast enough*. Hadlow wrapped Sandra in a corn sack and hid her in the boot of a car. He then joined the local community in searching for her. When police eventually arrested him he said: *Yes, I&#39;ve killed her. I&#39;ve been expecting you to pick me up*. He served 23 years in jail and was paroled in 1985. Not long after his parole he married divorced mother-of-eight Leonie Rose Moody, whom he met in Toowoomba. The pair lived on the Darling Downs for some years before moving to Roma. In 1990, he abducted, raped and murdered nine-year-old Stacey-Ann Tracy. Hadlow grabbed Stacey-Ann on her way to school, sexually assaulted and killed her, dumped her body near a creek and then returned home like nothing had happened. Just as he did after he murdered Sandra, Hadlow took part in the search for Stacey-Ann when news emerged of her disappearance. He was arrested after evidence linking him to Stacey-Ann&#39;s body was found. He pleaded not guilty to murder but a jury disagreed. He was sentenced to life in prison and his file was marked never to be released. He died in 2007 at the age of 65. Hadlow was married to the mother of The RED HEART Campaign founder Sherele Moody for a number of years before and after he murdered Stacey-Ann.

Marjorie and Clifford were found four days after their deaths with a .22 rifle and a half eaten apple nearby. Police spent six weeks searching across Queensland for their killer. Pressler flew under the radar, even acting as a pallbearer at the funeral of the Golcherts. On July 1, police arrested him. *I remember hitting Cliffy over the head with something in my hand. Marj started to cry and I hit her then,* he said in a confession. *I saw her finger was half cut off when she put her hand up to her head when I hit her. I then shot them both and put them out of their misery because they were howling and moaning.&#39;&#39; Pressler tried to kill himself after he was caught and this meant his trial was delayed. He was eventually convicted of murder and sentenced to life. Around 13 years after the killing of Marjori and Clifford, Pressler&#39;s uncle died, leaving a signed confession saying that he was the murderer. Pressler&#39;s mother Enid took the note to police, telling them the dead man - her brother-in-law - had dictated it to her and that he had signed it.  Pressler had been campaigning for her son to be released since he was first charged. Police did not believe her story or that the dead man had signed the confession, so they ended up charging her with killing her brother-in-law. She was acquitted at trial. Pressler was paroled in 1975 at the age of 45, still claiming he was innocent.  He went back to Bundaberg and became a wealthy farmer. He is no longer alive.

He was also convicted for the murders of three men - Brian Weir, 29; John Sturkey, 19; and George Walmsley, 54. Known as the *Night Caller*, Cooke started killed his victims by running them over or shooting, strangling or stabbing them to death. He was eventually caught after police found a gun connected to him. He confessed to eight murders and 14 attempted murders but pleaded not guilty due to mental impairment. A jury disagreed and he was sentenced to death. He was executed in October, 1964. Jillian&#39;s death was originally blamed on Darryl Beamish who was convicted and served 15 years despite Cooke&#39;s original confession. His conviction was over-turned in 2005. John Button was originally convicted with killing Rosemary but this was over-turned in 2002.

No one has been charged with Elsie&#39;s murder but it is believed she was a victim of John Wayne Glover who murdered at least six other women. Glover was convicted of the murders of Muriel Falconer, Joan Sinclair, Margaret Pahud, Olive Cleveland, Gwendolin Mitchelhill and Winfreda Ashton. It is also suspected that he killed Wanda Amundsen (November 21, 1986), Emmie May Anderson, 78, in East Melbourne (October 19, 1961); Irene Kiddle, 61, St Kilda (March 22, 1963); Christina Yankos, 63, Albert Park (April 9, 1968); Florence Broadhurst, 78, Paddington (October 15, 1977); and Josephine McDonald, 72, Ettalong (August 29, 1984). Glover came to police attention not long before he killed Joan Sinclair, after he molested an elderly patient at a hospital. Medical staff called police. Officers tracked him down and a few weeks later left him a note requesting he come in to see them.  He was under police surveillance when he went to Joan&#39;s home. Around three hours later officers realised there was no movement. Six hours later they entered the property to find Joan dead. Her head had been beaten with a hammer and her clothing was wrapped around her neck. Glover also sexually violated her, although it is not known if she was alive when he did this. He denied raping her. Police found him in Joan&#39;s bathtub.  He had overdosed on tablets and wrote a suicide note with the words *no more grannies*. He survived, and pleaded not guilty due to diminished responsibility but he was convicted. During the trial it emerged he had a poker machine addiction and the easiest way to feed his habit was to bash and rob elderly women. He was sentenced to consecutive life terms and killed himself in 2005. * NOTE: The RED HEART Campaign is seeking photos of Joan Sinclair, Emmie May Anderson, Elsie Boyes and Christina Yankos.

Four years before killing Charmaine, Richardson was sentenced to 12 months&#39; jail for violating other little girls in Mackay. During his interview with police, Richardson admitted killing Charmaine, telling officers *it just came over me*. He tried killing her with his belt and when that failed, he strangled her with his hands.   Richardson was convicted and sentenced to life in prison with hard labour. After serving 21 years, a religious organisation convinced authorities to allow Richardson day release so he could work as a delivery driver in Townsville.

Elsie also worked in a range of jobs, including as an escort in Sydney before moving to Melbourne. She suffered from extreme poverty and was an alcoholic who spent significant time in prison after defending herself with a razor blade when attacked while living on the streets. Women in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were rarely held in high regard so she suffered quite horrendously at the hands of the legal system. Days before Elsie died, 10-year-old Phyllis McIlvenie found her pleading for help as she lay wounded on the burning remains of a rubbish tip. Phyllis said Elsie told her that *her man punched her into the fire*. Elsie&#39;s body was found two days later. It appears no one was ever held to account over Elsie&#39;s death.

<p>Simply tap a RED HEART to interact with the Australian Femicide &amp; Child Death Map.</p>
<p>This Map is a companion project to The RED HEART Campaign's Memorial to Women and Children Lost to Violence.</p>
<p>The Map honours and remembers those lost to murder, manslaughter, neglect and other abuses, regardless of the perpetrator gender or relationship to the victim.</p>
<p>There are no statistics on the Map. It is a journalism-based story-driven project and it is far from finished.</p>
<p>The deaths documented here go back as far as white settlement in Australia and I am adding more victims weekly.</p>
<p>I acknowledge there are difficulties tracking Indigenous deaths and am working to overcome this.</p>
<p>Most of the information is publicly available and the material is sourced from coroner reports, media stories, police and family and friends of victims. &nbsp;- Sherele Moody</p></div>
