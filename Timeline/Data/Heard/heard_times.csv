20 have with Rocky about the alleged incident?               11:14
21       A   I just made sure she was okay.  To be very
22 honest with you, there had been quite a bit of
23 interpersonal drama over the preceding days that I
24 wanted to extricate myself from, so I kind of kept

2 you referring to interpersonal drama between you and
3 Rocky, or other people?
4       A   No.  Other people in the group.  It was a
5 pretty large group in pretty tight circumstances and      11:14
6 a very stressful time for everybody.  Lots of
7 travel, big wedding, things of that nature.  There
8 was, you know, the normal -- the normal
9 interpersonal issues that occur between very close
10 friends and family on a wedding weekend.                  11:14
11       Q   I know it was a certain -- it was a
12 substantial period of time ago, but if -- it's a
13 matter of some significance if you hear that
14 somebody has beat your wife; correct?
15       A   I wouldn't characterize it that way.            11:15
16       Q   Somebody has been violent with your wife;
17 correct?
18       A   I wouldn't characterize it that way
19 either.
20       Q   Well, how would you characterize it?            11:15
21       A   I would characterize it as there was some
22 kind of physical contact, and, quite frankly, I --
23 it didn't seem serious.  They didn't portray it that
24 way, they portrayed it differently, and I trusted
25 them.                                                     11:15",https://www.nickwallis.com/_files/ugd/5df505_72a55d0c9a0b4e919b4b509eed3052c4.pdf#page=12
