Incident 1: The Tattoo Incident, early 2013   
 
There  is  limited  evidence  on  this  alleged  first  incidence  of  violence.  The  Defendants’  case 
seeks to say that it arose in the unlikely scenario that Mr Depp reacted badly to a joke about 
an infamous tattoo which he has, one which Ms Heard would have seen countless times by 
early 2013. Further how the incident allegedly panned out differed when put to Mr Depp in 
cross-examination (she “eyeballed” him) from how Ms Heard later described her reactions to 
when she was first allegedly hit, when she was cross-examined on DAY 11 (she was “kind of 
still laughing”).

    25      A.  Yes. 
 
 
P.633   
    21      Q.  It is accepted by Ms. Heard that that incident took place on 
    22          22nd March, not 8th March, as she originally said.  Now, on 
    23          this occasion, you were, as you have said, in the middle of 
    24          filming the Keith Richards documentary; is that right? 
 
    25      A.  Yes. 
 
P. 634  
    21      Q.  Can you explain to this court then, what was the actual 
    22          argument that took place over the night and into the next 
    23          morning of the day that you were meant to be on set for the 
    24          Keith Richards documentary? 
 
    25      A.  The night prior to Ms. Heard had had a dinner party with all 
 
P.635  
     2          of her friends over.  And it was, a Hispanic woman, a girl, 
     3          who was a friend of Amber's and we struck up a conversation 
     4          and she started to speak of a mutual friend of theirs in 
     5          Spain, I believe his name was Raphael, he was a police 
     6          officer.  But Ms. Heard had explained to me he was an old 
     7          friend. 
 
     8      Q.  Slow down slightly, his Lordship is taking a note. 
 
     9      A.  Pardon me.  Ms. Heard explained to me she was going to visit 
    10          him in Spain at one point that he was just a friend, all that, 
    11          that nothing had ever happened between them and she went and 
    12          stayed with him for, I believe it was ten days, two weeks.  On 
    13          the night before the Keith Richards documentary day, I had, 
    14          the young lady had told me of a ---- 
 
    15      Q.  This is the Hispanic friend? 
 
    16      A.  Yes.  I cannot remember her name, sorry.  She had told me that 
    17          she also, that he is a very nice guy, that she also goes and 
    18          stays there, and that they all sort of slept in his bed and 
    19          Ms. Heard was -- she put it to me that Ms. Heard had been in 
    20          a, had had an affair with him before.  So, I for all intents 
    21          and purposes had found Ms. Heard to be lying about the 
    22          situation and her relationship with this man. 
 
    23      Q.  That was the night before.  Did that give rise to a

     4          and get to the bottom of it, and so that I could know the 
     5          truth, I wanted just the truth.  She was still very reluctant 
     6          to give that to me.  So, I wanted to stay until we got to the 
     7          bottom of it.  I called ---- 
 
     8      Q.  I was going to ask, you said you wanted to stay.  It was put, 
     9          or suggested in the witness statement -- I am not sure it was 
    10          put to you, but it is suggested in Ms. Heard's witness 
    11          statement that you were deliberately keeping everyone waiting 
    12          and that was irresponsible.  Did you or did you not have any 
    13          contact with the film set? 
 
    14      A.  I did.  Once the argument had commenced, I called my first 
    15          assistant director and my director of photography and the gent 
    16          who pulls focus on the camera, and since it was not a day 
    17          where I had to interview Keith Richards, it was a day of Keith 
    18          Richards and Tom Waits were at my studio and they were 
    19          recording and playing and we were documenting it.  So, I just 
    20          told them, there is nothing that I can do there, I am going to 
    21          be a bit late.  All you have to do is point the camera and 
    22          shoot, just capture whatever Mr. Waits and Mr. Richards are 
    23          willing to give. 
 
    24      Q.  I will not take you to the text as we do not need to go there. 
    25          So that is the argument that you were talking about, when you 
 
P.637 
     2          said ""the nasty argument"" in answer to Ms. Wass? 
 
     3      A.  Yes. 
 
 
P.638  
    21      Q.  Now, Mr. Depp, the allegation against you was that on the 
    22          night or in the early hours of the morning of that day, the 
    23          night before the early hours of the morning, you hit Ms. Heard 
    24          so hard that it bust her lip so blood was left on the wall as 
    25          a result.  That is what Ms. Heard said.

     6          particular incident that I had referred to as disco bloodbath 
     7          is because it got some blood on a little of my T-shirt, but 
     8          also on the wall, and that was in relation to a different 
     9          incident.  I remember that well because he had his rings on 
    10          and when he backhanded me, it cut the inside of my lip.  So 
    11          even though this was taken before the incident ---- 
 
 
P.1796 
 
9      Q.  ""Eventually we got him to come down enough, we got in the 
    10          car"", and then you give quite a detailed, an elaborate account 
    11          of how he was holding the dog out of the car.  When you got on 
    12          set, ""he walked in as if he had not kept anyone waiting, 
    13          everyone welcomed him as if nothing had happened, even though 
    14          I knew people were really frustrated and pissed off that he 
    15          had not showed up all day.""

    17          is an argument that goes on overnight, it is over the 
    18          painting, and during the argument, Mr. Depp attempts to set 
    19          fire to the painting, that is one aspect.  The other aspect is 
    20          a very serious assault upon you with him hitting you in the 
    21          face with the back of his hand, drawing blood, some of which 
    22          ended up on the wall.  Can you describe how that actually 
    23          happened, the blood went from your lip to the wall, tell us 
    24          how that happened? 
 
    25      A.  I did not watch the blood itself.

     5          other more violent things ---- 
 
     6      Q.  We will go a lot quicker if you answer the question about this 
     7          incident.  How did he manage to assault you in such a way that 
     8          blood spattered on the wall?  Can you explain in a little more 
     9          detail, please? 
 
    10      A.  I am, I am trying to explain to you the best I can. 
 
    11      Q.  Of this incident, please? 
 
    12      A.  That is exactly what I was doing. 
 
    13      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Let us get on with your description, as to how 
    14          this occurred. 
 
    15      THE WITNESS:  Thank you, your Lordship.  So, back then, it was 
    16          just slaps or backhands.  And when he backhanded me, it was 
    17          still so early, it was a shock, it was fairly traumatic at 
    18          that time.  In retrospect I feel different, but at the time 
    19          that is all I happened to notice.  I felt his rings hit my 
    20          mouth, my teeth. 
 
    21      MS. LAWS:  How close to the wall were you? 
 
    22      A.  We were standing -- it was actually in his downtown place, we 
    23          were not at Orange.  It happened on the 8th.  That is what 
    24          I was trying to describe to you earlier. 
 
    25      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  You were not at Orange, you were where? 
 
P.1798 
     2      A.  We were at his downtown place. 
 
     3      Q.  Is that Sweetzer? 
 
     4      A.  No.  A different, this is what we call the Eastern Columbia 
     5          Building.  And as I tried to describe in my seventh of the 
     6          witness statement, all of the details of these incidents 
     7          remain true, I remember them perfectly.  There has been a

DATE,14,the 8th,,"     3      A.  Johnny back in those days had not gotten to the point of 
 
     4          choking me or any of the other, headbutting me or any of the 
     5          other more violent things ---- 
 
     6      Q.  We will go a lot quicker if you answer the question about this 
     7          incident.  How did he manage to assault you in such a way that 
     8          blood spattered on the wall?  Can you explain in a little more 
     9          detail, please? 
 
    10      A.  I am, I am trying to explain to you the best I can. 
 
    11      Q.  Of this incident, please? 
 
    12      A.  That is exactly what I was doing. 
 
    13      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Let us get on with your description, as to how 
    14          this occurred. 
 
    15      THE WITNESS:  Thank you, your Lordship.  So, back then, it was 
    16          just slaps or backhands.  And when he backhanded me, it was 
    17          still so early, it was a shock, it was fairly traumatic at 
    18          that time.  In retrospect I feel different, but at the time 
    19          that is all I happened to notice.  I felt his rings hit my 
    20          mouth, my teeth. 
 
    21      MS. LAWS:  How close to the wall were you? 
 
    22      A.  We were standing -- it was actually in his downtown place, we 
    23          were not at Orange.  It happened on the 8th.  That is what 
    24          I was trying to describe to you earlier. 
 
    25      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  You were not at Orange, you were where? 
 
P.1798 
     2      A.  We were at his downtown place. 
 
     3      Q.  Is that Sweetzer? 
 
     4      A.  No.  A different, this is what we call the Eastern Columbia 
     5          Building.  And as I tried to describe in my seventh of the 
     6          witness statement, all of the details of these incidents 
     7          remain true, I remember them perfectly.  There has been a 
     8          mistake with dates and which incident happened when, and I, in 
     9          reviewing materials, have understood that that particular 
    10          moment, which we later called ""disco bloodbath"", happened on 
    11          the 8th downtown and this is ---- 
 
    12      MS. LAWS:  We will come on to -- sorry ----

    14      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Please, I do want to hear one person at a 
    15          time.

timexy,16,23 March 2013,"TIMEX3 type=""DATE"" value=""2013-03-23T00:00:00""","     3      MS. LAWS:  Yes, it is the angle I am interested in.  Was the wall 
     4          to your right, literally facing your face there or was it 
     5          behind you? 
 
     6      THE WITNESS:  I cannot quite recall exactly where the wall -- if 
     7          that was the doorway, I was closer to the doorway, or if I was 
     8          facing towards the wall, but I was facing towards the living 
     9          room. 
 
    10      Q.  What did the blood spatter look like?  You say you do not know 
    11          how it happened, but what did it look like?  I am sure that 
    12          was memorable. 
 
    13      A.  To be honest, we made light of it.  It was remarkable because 
    14          of the, of what had happened, but I was quick to make light of 
    15          it.  I know that sounds hard to imagine, but I was so ready to 
    16          believe that it would never happen again that we were quick to 
    17          make light of it. 
 
    18      Q.  There was no blood on the wall, which is why you cannot 
    19          describe it in any way, is it not? 
 
    20      A.  That is not true. 
 
 
Ms Heard’s account evolved further when she was shown a photograph of herself with Ian 
McLagan taken on 23 March 2013, but once again Ms Heard sought to cover herself by 
giving evidence that she might be able to see an injury on a photograph where she clearly 
had none. 
 
P.1809 
23      A.  I do not know his name. 
 
    24      Q.  You do not know his name.  He is, and he is ---- 
 
    25      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Ian McLagan. 
 
P.1810 
     2      MS. LAWS:  He is the guitarist for Keith Richards. 
 
     3      THE WITNESS:  Oh yes, I am vaguely familiar with this. 
 
     4      Q.  You are familiar with this photograph.  It shows you with a 
     5          clear face, does it not? 
 
     6      A.  What do you mean? 
 
     7      Q.  No injury? 
 
     8      A.  No, I cannot see an injury to my face. 
 
     9      Q.  No injury at all on that? 
 
    10      A.  I cannot really tell if my lip is bruised. 
 "
DATE,17,23rd March,,"    11      Q.  There might be an injury on that? 
 
    12      A.  There might be an injury to my lip, if you look at my bottom 
    13          lip, it looks swollen to me. 
 
    14      Q.  It looks swollen? 
 
    15      A.  My bottom lip does. 
 
    16      Q.  Does it? 
 
    17      A.  My bottom lip looks swollen to me, yes. 
 
    18      Q.  This was taken on 23rd March, and I will come to why in a 
    19          moment.  This was taken the day after the assault ---- 
 
P.1824 
     3      Q.  The one I showed you, both of the photographs.  You have seen 
     4          both of them? 
 
     5      A.  All I saw was a swollen lip in that one. 
 
     6      Q.  I suggest you are making that suggestion now because you have 
     7          got quite a difficult path to tread because of the lies that 
     8          you have woven? 
 
     9      A.  I still have not seen one so I disagree. 
 
    10      Q.  You have produced a photograph -- well, you have seen two.  I 
    11          have shown you two so I do not think I need go back to them. 
    12          Of the photographs I have shown you, you say there is one with 
    13          a swollen lip? 
 
    14      A.  Yes. 
 
    15      Q.  And I am suggesting to you that you have a difficult path to 
    16          tread because you have woven a web of lies that you have had 
    17          to shift and change according to when evidence has emerged 
    18          about this Keith Richards documentary; do you agree or not? 
 
    19      A.  I disagree.  The more evidence I have come across, the more 
    20          clarity I have on what happened. 
 
 
Ms Heard was also compelled to give an incredible account of a painting by her former partner, 
Tasys  van  Ree.  Her  sister,  Whitney  Henriques,  was  forced  to  say  she  had  merged  an 
incidence of serious violence against her sister over one painting in 2013 with a joke with Mr 
Depp about defacing another painting by Ms Van Ree in 2014.

    3          realised that you had got the date wrong was literally the

     5          two o'clock?

     7      Q.  When did you first realise that you had got the date so very 
     8          wrong of this incident? 
 
     9      A.  It was very recently.  But I honestly, that is it, I just 
    10          realised recently. 
 
    11      Q.  How did you realise recently? 
 
    12      A.  I was going over text messages between Nathan Holmes and 
    13          I, his former assistant. 
 
    14      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.  (Pause) Nathan Holmes, who is

    17      Q.  When you say ""I"", you mean you yourself? 
 
    18      A.  Yes, I was going over my own text messages, my own 
    19          conversation with his former assistant Nathan Holmes. 
 
    20      MS. LAWS:  It certainly was not a case of Amber saying, ""We have 
    21          got it wrong, we have got to sort this out""? 
 
    22      A.  I disagree with that.

same injury Ms Heard had claimed to be able to see when giving her evidence. 
 "
DATE,24,the day,,"     2      A.  I am sorry, I do not know that. 
 
     3      Q.  Which is why your sister herself, when I showed this to her 
     4          and informed her of the date, or the date we are saying it is, 
     5          your sister was forced to say she had an injury to her lip? 
 
     6      A.  I disagree with that statement. 
 
     7      Q.  And you know she is forced to say that because otherwise both 
     8          your story and her story would completely fall apart, would it 
     9          not? 
 
    10      A.  I disagree. 
 
    11      Q.  It is ridiculous to suggest that this photograph shows any 
    12          sort of injury? 
 
    13      A.  I disagree. 
 
    14      Q.  I think you have indicated that on the day of this assault, 
    15          her face -- and I have gone through it several times -- was 
    16          swollen, not just her lip, her face was swollen, her lip was 
    17          split? 
 
    18      A.  Yes.

    20      A.  I see makeup and a split lip.

    19          which you wrote in 2019, where you say you had a conversation 
    20          with your sister about the painting, what you had done was 
    21          added in a detail completely by mistake of something that 
    22          happened a year later? 
 
    23      A.  I simply merged two paintings that he defaced into one event. 
    24          That is what happened.  It was a mistake.  It was two separate 
    25          paintings, but it was because I just merely merged the two.

    16          year, was that you did not look at it closely, Amber told you 
    17          a few days later he tried to burn it, and Amber also then, in 
    18          that conversation, told you that when that failed, so when him 
    19          trying to burn it failed, he had scratched out her signature 
    20          to Tasya van Pee.  So the whole of that second part of that

    23      A.  That is not true.  She told me that he tried to burn the 
    24          painting and when I was recalling the accounts to put the 
    25          statement together, in my head, I mistakenly recalled that he

    14      Q.  That trailer that you stayed in with Ms. Heard got smashed up, 
    15          did it not? 
 
    16      A.  A bathroom sconce got smashed up.  I did get very -- I was 
    17          very upset at being yet again treated as the, pardon the 
    18          expression, the turd in the punch bowl, and that was quite 
    19          unpleasant.  I did not feel that I deserved to be screamed at, 
    20          demeaned, and treated like garbage for having done something 
    21          that I felt was right and correct.  So, during the height of 
    22          the argument, I punched the glass art deco light fixture in 
    23          the bathroom, above the bathroom mirror, and smashed it. 
 
    24      Q.  The trailer was very, very badly damaged the next day. There 
    25          was a wall lamp, a sconce as you call it, hanging off the 
 
P.243 
     2          wall, but there was mess everywhere, absolutely everywhere. 
     3          You had trashed the trailer? 
 
     4      A.  I am going to have to say, no, I did not. 
 
     5      Q.  You just limited your anger to tearing off the wall lamp; is 
     6          that right? 
 
     7      A.  No, I did not tear off the wall lamp, Ms. Wass.  I punched the 
     8          lighting fixture, the glass around the bulb. 
 
     9      Q.  All right.  Do you remember Kirsty Sexton coming into the 
    10          trailer the next morning? 
 
    11      A.  I do not remember Kirsty Sexton coming into the trailer the 
    12          next morning.  I remember going to the manager of Hicksville. 
 
The Defendants, presumably to increase the seriousness of the damage, say that Mr Depp’s 
“security team” had to deal with the owners/ managers about the damage. But Mr Depp dealt 
with it himself and Malcolm Connolly gave evidence that he was the only security with Mr 
Depp on that trip and he had nothing to do with the owners about damage to the trailer. Ms 
Sexton’s echoing of Ms Heard’s line about the “security team” should be rejected. 
 
    13      Q.  Yes, with your security? 
 
    14      A.  I am sorry? 
 
    15      Q.  With your security team? 
 
    16      A.  No. 
 
    17      Q.  Were your security team there?

     4          you, please, Ms. Sexton.  I want to ask you about Hicksville, 
     5          which we know was in the summer of 2013. 
 
     6      THE WITNESS:  Yes. 
 
     7      Q.  Can you first of all confirm what damage you saw to the 
     8          trailer where Ms. Heard and Mr. Depp were living? 
 
     9      A.  I saw broken glass strewn everywhere and it looked like window 
    10          coverings or cloth had been ripped and thrown around the 
    11          place. 
 
    12      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute, please.  Broken glass 
    13          everywhere, and you said something else? 
 
    14      A.  A fabric, I remember seeing torn fabric, either like curtain 
    15          fabric or  I do not know, bedding.  It was fabric that was 
    16          strewn around, everything was in disarray.  Like (unclear) and 
    17          some of it, like, broken things just everywhere. 
 
    18      Q.  Was there any conversation between yourself and Ms. Heard "

    18      A.  Mr. Deuters and I had a conversation.  Ms. Heard was still 
    19          very upset and I think very -- she was very stubborn about 
    20          hearing anything that did not ring true with her side of 
    21          things.  And on many occasions, I am somewhat embarrassed to 
    22          say, that I had to tell Mr. Deuters, and I recall telling 
    23          Mr. Deuters, just agree with whatever she said, just placate 
    24          her.  I can't take it any more, no more fights, no more 
 
P.321 
 
     3      Q.  That was the plan that you cooked up with Mr. Deuters, was it, 
     4          when he told you what had happened? 
 
     5      A.  Yes.  We cooked up a plan to placate Ms. Heard, but in fact 
     6          that was not cooked up then, it was cooked up a lot longer, 
     7          prior. 
 
     8      Q.  Before the plane incident at all? 
 
 
    16      Q.  Did you tell Mr. Deuters that you did not remember much about 
    17          the journey? 
 
    18      A.  I do not recall telling Mr. Deuters that I did not remember 
    19          anything about the journey.  I remember having a conversation 
    20          with Mr. Deuters saying, ""Please, just tell her whatever she 
    21          wants to hear, placate her"". 
 
    22      Q.  I understand that.  But that conversation was two years 
    23          beforehand, you tell us? 
 
    24      A.  No no no.  That placation started years before.  It became a 
    25          necessary tool to be able to deal with Ms. Heard without her

    15          of context.  I never used the word ""doctored"".  I never said 
    16          that to a solitary soul. 
 "
DATE,48,the day,,"    17      MS. WASS:  Let us take that in stages, if I may.  TMZ is some sort 
    18          of celebrity publication. 
 
    19      A.  As I believe, yes. 
 
    20      Q.  And they asked you for your comment, did they? 
 
    21      A.  No. 
 
    22      Q.  How did they come to say that you said, it is my fault, 
    23          I thought you had said somebody asked you about the texts? 
 
    24      A.  It was Johnny's counsel at the time. 
 
    25      Q.  A lawyer? 
 
P.794  
     2      A.  A lawyer or somebody who worked with the lawyers.  I guess his 
     3          divorce lawyers or his divorce team, and they asked me about 
     4          the texts, because they had come out.  And they said, are 
     5          these real, and I said yes.  And they said, can you say any 
     6          more about them?  And I said, well, they are taken out of 
     7          context, you know, what I meant by that is really just the 
     8          bigger picture.  I never spoke to TMZ and I never said to 
     9          anyone, even the counsel, that they were doctored. 
 
    10      Q.  I mean, when did you first see this article? 
 
    11      A.  Probably the day it came out.  It was very distressing. 
 
    12      Q.  Yes.  Did you phone up the editor of TMZ and say, ""Look, 
    13          I have been quoted as saying these texts are doctored, that is 
    14          not what I am saying at all""? 
 
    15      A.  It did not occur to me.  I did not really want to be involved 
    16          in any shape or form.  I felt like my goodwill was being 
    17          thrown back in my face and somehow these texts got leaked. 
    18          Someone had a conversation with TMZ that was not me.  In 
    19          retrospect ---- 
 
    20      Q.  Forgive me, I interrupted you. 
 
    21      A.  In retrospect, I would have loved to have had the courage to 
    22          say that to TMZ.  I may be even have asked his counsel at the 
    23          time, I do not recall though.  I may have had a conversation 
    24          with them after the fact, but I do not recall. 
 
 
Mr Deuters rejected the notion that Mr Depp had been (as Ms Heard would say), “the monster” 
on the flight from Boston and explained that the drugs (opiates and marijuana) which Mr Depp 
was using around that time had the effect of making him introverted; he described them as 
“down drugs”

DATE,52,8          ago,,"     3          this instance, I used a word, the adjective that she used, 
     4          as ---- 
 
     5      Q.  You mean kicked? 
 
     6      A.  Yes, kicked.  I used that word as, yes, a method, I suppose, 
     7          that was the method that came -- obviously this is some time 
     8          ago now, I cannot remember my exact thinking, but yes, looking 
     9          back at it with the benefit of hindsight, I simply used a word 
    10          that she had used to me, because I thought that was a word she 
    11          would agree with, would get the desired effect. 
 
    12      Q.  In your experience of Ms. Heard, do you think she would have 
    13          been placated had you told her that she was wrong about what 
    14          had happened in the incident? 
 
    15      A.  No.  I would not have taken that route. 
 
    16      Q.  Do you think you would have made things better for Mr. Depp if 
    17          you has contradicted her? 
 
    18      A.  No, definitely not. 
 
    19      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.  (Pause) 
 
    20      MR. SHERBORNE:  (To the witness) You said in answer to Ms. Wass, 
    21          if had you done that, you were afraid things would go south, 
    22          was the phrase you used? 
 
    23      THE WITNESS:  Yes. 
 
    24      Q.  Mr. Deuters, given what you knew of Mr. Depp and he had said 
    25          to you, how would Mr. Depp have felt if things had gone south, 
 
P.850 
     2          because of what you had said? 
 
     3      A.  He would not have been very happy with the situation, and, 
     4          yes. 
 
     5      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Sorry, this is now about Mr. Depp's reaction 
     6          if things had gone south; is that the question? 
 
     7      MR. SHERBORNE:  Well, Mr. Deuters had said in answer to Ms. Wass, 
     8          ""Why did you not say he was just being playful?"", and 
     9          Mr. Deuters said ""Things would have gone south if I had."" 
    10          I was asking him, given what Mr. Depp had asked him to do, if 
    11          the net result of telling her he was just being playful was 
    12          that things would have gone south, how would Mr. Depp have 
    13          reacted to that, and Mr. Deuters said he would not have been 
    14          very happy. 
 
    15      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Thank you.

     5      A.  No, it is not.  It was a mistake in the divorce separation. 
 
     6      Q.  You just include any photographs, anything you can, in a very 
     7          cavalier way, do you not?

Ms Heard’s allegation that she was assaulted by Mr Depp in their hotel room in Tokyo when 
they flew in for the premier of one of Mr Depp’s films lacks credibility. As Mr Depp explained 
his two children had come on the trip with them. They had an adjourning room. That fact not 
only undermines this specific allegation, but it also undermines the Defendants’ more general 
narrative that Mr Depp carried out his heinous assaults on Ms Heard when he so drunk or out 
of control on drugs that he could not recall what he had done.

17      Q.  That is in January 2015.  You explained that you were on a 
    18          trip to Tokyo and that you went not only with Ms. Heard, but 
    19          also with Lily-Rose, your daughter, and Jack?

    22          have been 15 or 16 and Jack 12 or 13? 
 
    23      A.  Somewhere around that.

     9      A.  We were all together and it was fine. 
 
    10      Q.  It was in that context that it was suggested to you -- and I 
    11          will not read out all the allegations again -- that you 
   12          shoved, wrestled her to the floor, grabbed her by the hair, 
    13          yelled at her, Ms. Heard said she was crying on the floor, and 
    14          this happened in hotel.  Where would the children have been 
    15          when you were in the hotel bedroom? 
 
    16      A.  They were either in our room or their room at all times. 
 
    17      Q.  If Lily-Rose or Jack had seen any marks or injuries on 
    18          Ms. Heard's face or body at the time, would they have asked 
    19          her about that, do you know?

The  cross-examination  of  Mr  Depp  focused  on  drugs,  but  not  violence.  It  also  focused  on 
matters which are not probative of violence, for example Mr Depp’s disappointment with the 
state of the film he was shooting and Mr Deuters’ attempt to cheer him up. The dark language 
used by Mr Depp in a text message to his friend, Paul Bettany, relied upon by the Defendants, 
was nothing to the point. 
 
The evidence of third parties, in particular Mr Ben King, is important. Mr King was frank about 
the damage to the house, but his evidence also shows that Ms Heard’s more lurid account (in 
her statement and then in cross-examination) cannot be believed. There was no urine from 
Mr  Depp  “peeing  on  walls  and  carpet”,  no  dripping  blood,  raw  meat,  potatoes  and  gravy 
smeared on a door. Further while he noticed diagonal cut marks on her arms, he saw no other 
injuries.  
 
He did not see or learn about a telephone smashed to the point of disappearing which featured 
so graphically in Ms Heard’s account of how Mr Depp injured his finger.  
 
Had  Ms  Heard  wanted  to  leave  the  house,  she  could  have  done  so,  whether  through 
contacting security (who were hired by the production company), calling someone, or walking 
out the glass doors of the bedroom. 
 
Instead  she  was a  very active  participant  in the argument  on  8  March  2015.  The  evidence 
supports the view that she was not just responsible for one broken bottle as she claimed, but 
other damage too – including some of the writing on the bathroom mirror. While Mr Depp takes 
responsibility for the damage which he caused, Ms Heard proved incapable of accepting that 
she had done anything – on her account it was all one-way – but despite that she did not leave

     5          you, right next to your face, smashing it so many times hard

    13          not dispute that you said that on this day? 
 
    14      A.  Exactly. 
 
    15      MS. LAWS:  The reality is that if what you are saying is true, 
    16          what has happened to you is really traumatic and serious.  You 
    17          have called your sister and it would be the very first thing 
    18          you would tell her about, is it not, what had happened, all 
    19          the violence? 
 
    20      A.  No. 
 
    21      Q.  And you did not.

In fact, Ms Heard denied that the long recording taken in the house in Australia was recorded 
by her, despite it being on her phone.  Her explanation that the recording – obtained from her 
phone  –  was  somehow activated  by  Mr  Depp,  or  that  she  did  not  do this  herself,  and  was 
unaware of the recording for years, is completely implausible.  
 
P.1850 
     24      Q.  Are you saying that you did not make any recording whatsoever 
    25          of either the violence over those three days, or indeed when 
 
P.1851 
      2          it ended, and the aftermath which we have heard?  You made no 
     3          recording? 
 
     4      A.  I was not the one to make the recording.  Johnny picked up 
     5          what I believe is my phone, and at the time, I could not have 
     6          any lock or password on my phone.  It would have been a whole 
     7          other war.  He picked up my phone and he was not saying many 
     8          coherent things.  I was trying to understand him.  He pushed 
     9          ""Record"", hence why I did not know this recording existed 
    10          until way into my divorce or after.

    15      MS. LAWS:  The reality is that if what you are saying is true, 
    16          what has happened to you is really traumatic and serious.  You 
    17          have called your sister and it would be the very first thing 
    18          you would tell her about, is it not, what had happened, all 
    19          the violence? 
 
    20      A.  No. 
 
    21      Q.  And you did not. 
 
    22      A.  I do not know what I said to her because I do not remember a 
    23          phone call, but I certainly would not have ---- 
 
 
In fact, Ms Heard denied that the long recording taken in the house in Australia was recorded 
by her, despite it being on her phone.  Her explanation that the recording – obtained from her 
phone  –  was  somehow activated  by  Mr  Depp,  or  that  she  did  not  do this  herself,  and  was 
unaware of the recording for years, is completely implausible.

P.1851 
      2          it ended, and the aftermath which we have heard?  You made no 
     3          recording? 
 
     4      A.  I was not the one to make the recording.  Johnny picked up 
     5          what I believe is my phone, and at the time, I could not have 
     6          any lock or password on my phone.  It would have been a whole 
     7          other war.  He picked up my phone and he was not saying many 
     8          coherent things.  I was trying to understand him.  He pushed 
     9          ""Record"", hence why I did not know this recording existed 
    10          until way into my divorce or after.

     7      A.  There was a couch, sofa, flipped over.  It appeared to be that 
     8          he had set fire to one of the cushions because the carpet was 
     9          burned around it a little.

    11      A.  There was a broken window.  This is now on the main level. 
    12          I was upstairs in the bedroom level so I have only made it 
    13          down one flight.  There was one window broken and the 
    14          painting, in the living room area, where I had a painting area 
 
    15          set up in the corner, my paints were out.  It appeared to be

P.2067 
 
     2      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute please.  (Pause) Yes. 
 
     3      A.  He had wrapped pieces of food.  I had tried to make dinner the 
     4          night before.  I had just set it out.  I did not actually get 
     5          so far as to try to cook.  He had taken various things from 
     6          the fridge and smeared it, a lot of, like, smeared mashed 
     7          potatoes and gravy and then blood.  I walked down the stairs 
     8          where there was a significantly more, like pooling of blood on 
     9          the floor, on the steps leading downstairs.  I could see my 
    10          own bloody footprints, but I could also see tons of what 
    11          appeared to be dripping blood.  At the time, I assumed it was 
    12          from my own arms and hands and feet.  I did not know what -- 
   13          I think I just did not know what to make of it.  I make it

DATE,103,that day,,"    19      A.  Yes, I believe so.  After that moment, or after those moments, 
    20          he was so angry he punched the wall a few times.  He was 
    21          screaming at me and he had me by the neck.  I moved away when 
    22          he started hitting the hall.  He was punching the wall.  He 
    23          got carried away in that moment.  He saw the phone, the 
    24          receiver of the phone.  It was a like a mint green and cream 
    25          Bakelite sort of heavy plastic mounted phone on the wall. 
 
P.2070

     4      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.  (Pause) Yes. 
 
     5      A.  And he picks it up and the hand that had been on my neck 
     6          loosened a little bit as he focused on the phone, and 
     7          I stepped back, just with my upper body, while he proceeded to 
     8          instead of punching with his hand, fist, he used the phone. 
     9          He picked it up and hit it repeatedly over and over and over 
    10          again into the wall, screaming at the top of his lungs, and 
    11          I watched as this phone just was disappearing in front of my 
    12          own eyes.  Just every time he made impact with the wall, it 
    13          just was breaking off in shreds and I just watched him do it, 
    14          thinking, ""That phone has just disappeared.""  I did not know 
    15          he had severed his finger. 
 
    16      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Again, if I can try and bring you back to the 
    17          question, is it your understanding or belief that the cause of 
    18          Mr. Depp's injury to his finger was the phone? 
 
    19      A.  Yes, although I did not know it at the time. 
 
    20      MS. WASS:  You did not know it at the time.  (Pause) From the time 
    21          when that phone incident took place, how long was it until 
    22          anybody else came to the house, if you are able to help us? 
    23          If you are not, do not guess. 
 
    24      A.  That happened in the early morning hours the previous night, 
    25          or that day. 
 
P.2071 
2      Q.  When you say ""that happened"", do you mean the phone? 
 
     3      A.  I am sorry, the phone incident happened in the early hours of 
     4          the morning.  I discovered him downstairs and said we should 
     5          call security at around, I think, noon is my best 
     6          recollection. 
 
     7      Q.  So, up to 12 hours on your estimate; yes? 
 
     8      A.  Yes. 
 
     9      Q.  Can you describe Mr. Depp's state of mind during the time that "

    12      A.  Her feet were cut, but I did not see them at that point in 
    13          time because she had shoes on. 
 
    14      Q.  So, you are saying, are you, that it is the soles of her feet

    17      Q.  Describe what that looked like? 
 
    18      A.  Well, I believe it was a couple of days later, so they were 
    19          healing, and to my recollection it was smaller cuts on the 
    20          bottom of her feet.

    13      Q.  What she describes there, she says, four lines up, ""I lunged 
    14          at Johnny to stop him from hitting my sister and struck him to 
    15          protect her, instinctive reaction"", then this, ""Johnny grabbed 
    16          me by the hair with one hand""; do you see that? 
 
    17      A.  I do. 
 
    18      Q.  ""And hit me repeatedly in the head with the other.""  So, the 
    19          allegation is that you grabbed her by the hair with one hand 
    20          and you hit her repeatedly with the other.  I am just going to 
    21          ask you a few questions, Mr. Depp.  The day your finger was 
    22          cut was 8th March? 
 
    23      A.  Yes. 
 
    24      Q.  So, this is about two weeks later.  Can I ask you, after your 
    25          finger was cut off, was it left just unprotected with

     3          post-op. 
 
     4      Q.  Can you explain what the design is on that cast? 
 
     5      A.  It is a little dinosaur. 
 
     6      Q.  Was that the cast that was given to you or did you choose it? 
 
     7      A.  I figured, since I was going to be wearing this ridiculous 
     8          cast with a giant finger, I should have the children's wrap 
     9          around so at least it would make more fun.

DATE,109,DAY 9,,"     6      A.  Well, I do not know that I was called to Penthouse 5.  I was 
     7          being described something by Whitney.  I did go there. 
 
     8      Q.  Yes.  What Whitney told you was, ""Johnny destroyed Amber's 
     9          closet, there's some other damage, you're the lucky person 
    10          I should talk to"", and in fairness to you, you said, ""Yes, 
    11          I am coming"", in effect, did you not? 
 
    12      A.  No, I said I suppose so, because getting a phone call at that 
    13          time of the morning to me, it sounded like more drama. 
 
    14      Q.  ""I'm up"" meant you were awake; yes? 
 
    15      A.  Yes. 
 
    16      Q.  Did you eventually go to the flat? 
 
    17      A.  Yes, I did. 
 
    18      Q.  And to deal with the damage or chaos that we see in those 
    19          photographs? 
 
    20      A.  Yes.  I, along with another co-worker, turned up -- picked up  
    21      the racks and put them back where they were.  
 
 
DAY 9 (Cross-examination of Travis McGivern) 
 
P.1414 
   16      Q.  Did a time come when Ms. Heard and her sister, Whitney, were 
    17          on the mezzanine level of the staircase that goes from the 
    18          ground floor of the apartment to the upper storey of the 
    19          apartment?  Do you remember seeing that? 
 
    20      A.  Yes, ma'am. 
 
    21      Q.  Do you remember Mr. Depp being very angry? 
 
    22      A.  Yes. 
 
    23      Q.  And do you remember Mr. Depp being very angry because 
    24          Ms. Heard had accused him of having an affair with someone 
    25          called Rochelle? 
 
P.1415 
 
     2      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute. (Pause) Do you recall that, 
     3          Mr. McGivern? 
 
     4      A.  I do not.  I do not remember the specifics of what they were 
     5          fighting about. 
 
     6      MS. WASS:  But there was a scuffle -- do you know what I mean by 
     7          ""a scuffle"" -- at the mezzanine level of the stairs; do you 
     8          agree? "
DATE,111,18      Q.,,"    18      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Do you agree or disagree with that, 
    19          Mr. McGivern? 
 
    20      A.  It is hard for me.  You are asking me to speculate on what 
    21          would have happened if -- (Pause) 
 
 
P.1419 
 
18      Q.  Both Ms. Heard and Mr. Depp had to be restrained, did they 
    19          not? 
 
    20      A.  No, ma'am. 
 
    21      Q.  Are you able to assist us as to Nurse Lloyd coming to that 
    22          conclusion, since she was there at exactly the same time, 
    23          looking at exactly the same argument? 
 
    24      A.  You want me to tell you what Ms. Lloyd was thinking or confirm 
    25          how she felt was the situation? 
 
P.1420 
 
2      Q.  Nurse Lloyd is describing something quite different from what 
     3          you are describing, is she not? 
 
     4      A.  I will concur that all hell had broken loose.  I will also 
     5          again say that the only person that got physical that night 
     6          was Ms. Heard. 
 
     7      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Mr. McGivern, having seen those two texts from 
     8          Debbie Lloyd, does it change your evidence about this dispute 
     9          between Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard? 
 
    10      A.  No, it does not. 
 
    11      MS. WASS:  And you are giving evidence on oath, are you, that 
    12          neither you nor Ms. Lloyd had to restrain Mr. Depp at any 
    13          stage? 
 
    14      A.  I did not restrain him.  After Ms. Heard punched him, I walked 
    15          him down the stairs to get him out of the situation and to 
    16          protect him. 
 
    17      Q.  You had to pull Mr. Depp off Ms. Heard when he was trying to 
    18          punch her: what do you say about that? 
 
    19      A.  Is that a question? 
 
    20      Q.  That was a question.  What do you say about it? 
 
    21      A.  That is an unequivocal no, I did not. 
 
    22      Q.  You are lying about your description of this argument in order 
    23          to assist Mr. Depp, who was extremely angry and extremely "

DAY 11 (Cross-examination of Amber Heard) 
 
P.1775 
 
     14         What I am going to ask you about is that 
    15          during the deposition you were asked about the two incidents 
    16          we have covered, in April and May.  Also the stairs incidents 
    17          emerges during that deposition and also the tape that we have 
    18          played emerges in that deposition.  The stairs incident 
    19          emerges because the lawyers were asking you about whether you 
    20          had ever used any violence upon Mr. Depp.  Is that a fair 
    21          neutral summary of how it came to light? 
 
P.1776 
 
2          rather than having to read the deposition. 
 
     3      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Let us get to the question. 
 
     4      MS. LAWS:  The question is this: during the deposition, you are 
     5          covering in that deposition what happened on 21st April and 
     6          21st May.  So, you deal with that.  Do you remember that? 
 
     7      THE WITNESS:  Yes. 
 
     8      Q.  Also, in relation to other matters, you were asked about tapes 
     9          that were played, including that one tape we just heard.  Do 
    10          you remember that, on the deposition? 
 
    11      A.  I do not recall if they asked me about that one. 
 
    12      Q.  All right.  We will come on to that.  Also, you were asked 
    13          time and again about whether you had ever been violent to 
    14          Mr. Depp.  Do you remember those questions? 
 
    15      A.  Outside of self-defence. 
 
    16      Q.  You were asked the questions and you would always say it was 
    17          in self-defence.  Do you remember that? 
 
    18      A.  Specifically in self-defence of myself and my sister. 
 
    19      Q.  The stairs incident is one where I am going to suggest to you 
    20          this was a very nasty row between you and Mr. Depp, and it was 
    21          you that was the violent one? 
 
    22      A.  Johnny hit both myself and my sister.

     5      MS. LAWS:  And punched him in the face with a closed fist? 
 
     6      THE WITNESS:  I did strike Johnny that day in defence of my 
     7          sister.  He was about to push her down the stairs.  And the 
     8          moment before that happened, I remembered information I had 
     9          heard very recently, which is that he pushed a former 
    10          girlfriend, I believe it was Kate Moss, down the stairs. 
    11          I had heard this rumour from two people and it was fresh in my 
    12          mind.  When he moved to hit Whitney to push her out of the way 
    13          when she tried to intervene, I thought of that moment and in a 
    14          flash I reacted in defence of her.  I had been for years, for 
    15          years, Johnny's punching bag and for years I had never ever 
    16          hit him.  I had never so much as landed a blow, and I will 
    17          never forget this incident.  I will never forget it, because 
    18          it was the first time after all these years that I actually 
    19          struck him back.

DATE,116,that day,,"     6      A.  No.  To be clear, I have not had the liberty of time or space, 
     7          or energy even, to list every thought that crossed through my 
     8          mind in one of the many, many instances that are referenced 
     9          specifically in this proceeding.  During that deposition 
    10          I was, as you could hear, for the moments, minutes leading up 
    11          to being given a short chance to answer, I was interrupted by 
    12          14 different lawyers that were present.  I had anything but 
    13          the freedom to speak freely about my experience that day. 
 
    14      Q.  The question was, have you mentioned it in any of your 
    15          statements, and you said no.  You have had every opportunity, 
    16          if you wanted to, to mention that, have you not? 
 
    17      A.  I have not had every opportunity to list every thought that 
    18          went through my mind before any or all of the many instances 
    19          in which Johnny beat me up. 
 
    20      Q.  You have had, if you listen to the question ---- 
 
    21      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Well, Ms. Laws, I think you have made the 
    22          point. 
 
    23      MS. LAWS:  I have made the point about the statement.  This was a 
    24          separate point, if I may? 
 
    25      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  All right. 
 
P.1783 
 
     2      MS. LAWS:  In relation to documents.  It is not just statements, 
     3          it is documents drafted on your behalf in terms of the defence 
     4          document, the amended defence document, and the reamended 
     5          defence document, when you are able to go through whatever you 
     6          like, if you think it is relevant, to put in those documents. 
 
     7      A.  I have not had the freedom, the opportunity, for the pages, 
     8          the incidences listed in all the pages, all the documents, 
     9          every instance of every moment of every memory that has gone 
    10          through my mind at every single moment before one of the many 
    11          instances which led to Johnny beating me up.  I have not had 
    12          an opportunity to do that. 
 
    13      Q.  You are just making this up as you go along at times, are you 
    14          not? 
 
    15      A.  Absolutely not. 
 
    16      Q.  Throwing in details, new details sometimes, or details that 
    17          you have thought of literally on your feet, to try and make 
    18          your account more detailed ----

     4          stepped in and separated us"".  Do you see that?  Do you see 
     5          that sentence? 
 
     6      A.  I am looking for it.  Is it still 132?

    18          148B so you might need to go back.  You can tell from the 
    19          bottom numbers, 894.069.  (Pause)

   21          with ---- 
 
    22      MS. LAWS:  The bandage. 
 
    23      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Mr. Depp with the cast on his hand. 
 
    24      MS. LAWS:  That is right.  That is how his hand was in a cast on 
    25          that day, was it not? 
 
P.1786 
 
2      A.  Yes. 
 
     3      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute, please.  (Pause) Yes. 
 
     4      MS. LAWS:  He could not possibly have been grabbing you by the 
     5          hair with one hand and punching you with the other, as you 
     6          have described, could he? "

     3      Q.  This is your way of trying to minimise the fact that this 
     4          whole incident was Amber attacking Mr. Depp, are you not? 
 
     5      A.  I disagree with that statement.  I am telling the truth. 
 
 
 
Incident 10: S.E. Asia Train Journey  
 
The evidence about the nature of the train, its staffing and the presence of a security person, 
Malcolm Connolly, for Mr Depp and Ms Heard during their honeymoon completely 
undermine Ms Heard’s account of an unprovoked attack in their cabin where she screamed 
and/or Mr Depp was screaming at her. There is no evidence of any injury and Mr Connolly 
did not see any injuries.  
 
Day 5 (Re-examination of Mr Depp) 
 
Page 698  
10      MR. SHERBORNE:  Can I take you then to the next alleged incident, 
    11          Mr. Depp, incident 10 on the Southeast Asia train.  This was 
    12          part of your honeymoon; is that right? 
 
    13      THE WITNESS:  Yes. 
 
    14      Q.  It is July 2015.  Can I ask, was it just you and Ms. Heard who 
    15          were present on the train? 
 
    16      A.  We travelled with security, Malcolm Connolly, he was with us 
    17          for the entire honeymoon, for the trip. 
 
    18      Q.  You were not asked many questions about this by Ms. Wass, so 
    19          I am going to keep it very brief.  We know that Ms. Heard's 
    20          evidence is that you were very violent, according to her, you 
    21          hit her, you pushed her against the wall, you grasped her by 
    22          the throat and you caused her to fear for her very life; you 
    23          have seen that is what she says? 
 
    24      A.  Yes, I have seen it. 
 "
DATE,121,9          days,,"    25      Q.  I want to ask you a few questions.  Did you and Ms. Heard buy 
 
Page 699 
2          up the entire train? 
 
     3      A.  No, sir. 
 
     4      Q.  Did you just have your own cabin? 
 
     5      A.  Yes. 
 
     6      Q.  Did you keep yourself to yourself or did you mix with the 
     7          staff and so on; how did you conduct yourself during that? 
 
     8      A.  Well, you become quite familiar with the staff after a few 
     9          days and they were kind enough ---- 
 
    10      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  The staff you are talking about are the 
    11          railway staff or the security staff? 
 
    12      MR. SHERBORNE:  Yes, the railway staff. 
 
    13      THE WITNESS:  That is what I had understood, yes. 
 
    14      Q.  My Lord was right to ask.  We used the term before for people 
    15          who were working with you, as you describe? 
 
    16      A.  Yes, indeed.  Yes, we, the railroad staff were very 
    17          accommodating in terms of, when there is a crowded dining car, 
    18          things can tend to get a little bit strange, you know, people 
    19          take photographs of you eating and stuff.  So, they were kind 
    20          enough to, at a certain point, they had one dining car that 
    21          was empty, just for us; Malcolm would sit at the opposite end 
    22          of the dining car. 
 
    23      Q.  Other than dining, would you spend some time with the railway 
    24          staff or not? 
 
    25      A.  Most of the time, because you cannot smoke cigarettes in the 
 
Page 700 
     2          train, you have to go to the back of the train and smoke on 
     3          the outside, sort of, car, the bar car and then it is outside. 
     4          So, I would go down there quite a lot, and sure, got fairly 
     5          friendly with the staff, who were very kind. 
 
     6      Q.  Mr. Depp, were you violent at all to Ms. Heard during that 
     7          train journey? 
 
     8      A.  No.  No, not at all.

P.1938 
 
2          Dinner with Johnny and Amber and a number of others at their 
     3          apartment PH5 in November 2015.  At one point, late in the 
     4          meal, Amber went upstairs to look for Johnny and stayed up 
     5          there for a long time.  After a long time, they both came 
 
     6          downstairs.  When I asked Amber what had happened, she told me 
     7          that Johnny had thrown a bottle of wine at her in the bedroom. 
    8          I went to look and found that a full bottle of wine had hit 
     9          and broken a piece of art that Amber really loves above the 
    10          bed and that broken glass was scatted all over the bed.  I 
    11          went back downstairs and spoke to Amber.  She was upset, but 
    12          just wanted to get through dinner without further problems."" 
    13                Now, what she is saying is that this assault took place 
    14          while everyone was there, and that you had to go back 
    15          downstairs? 
 
    16      A.  No, she is saying ---- 
 
    17      Q.  She is wrong? 
 
    18      A.  Excuse me? 
 
    19      Q.  Is she wrong? 
 
    20      A.  No.  She is saying this part of it took place while she was 
    21          there and others were downstairs.  She was just describing the 
    22          first part of the fight. 
 
    23      Q.  So the incident has two parts now, does it? 
 
    24      A.  Our fights typically involved many parts.

    17      A.  No, that is untrue.  The two are unrelated. 
 
    18      Q.  This in fact is after midnight, so it is after the photograph 
    19          that I have showed you of you lying back next to Jack.  This 
    20          is time-stamped after midnight. 
 
    21      A.  Yes. 
 
    22      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.  (Pause) What was your response 
    23          to that? 
 
    24      A.  Yes. 
 
    25      MS. LAWS:  So, on your account, by that stage, Mr. Depp had 
 
P.1995 
 
     2          already been violent once to you; is that right?

The Court heard Mr Depp explain that generally he tried to avoid arguments with Ms Heard, 
he would “run away from fights”. Ms Heard’s allegation that she was injured, escalated in her 
evidence to asserting that Mr Depp had inflicted a broken nose on her. Having maintained, 
falsely, that Mr Depp ‘head butted’ her, she then made up an injury which would – had it 
happened – have been consistent with a headbutt. But there was no broken nose. None of 
the photographs support that (as Mr Depp noted one seemed to show a chapped lip) nor 
does any third-party testimony support that or Ms Heard’s evidence (given on DAY 12) that 
she “had two black eyes, a broken nose and a broken lip, bruised ribs, bruises all over my 
body.” Ms Pennington’s description differed and no photographs show what she said she 
saw, namely a swollen nose.  
 
Ms Heard account of her injuries is contradicted by what Tara Roberts saw, or in fact did not 
see, when Ms Heard went with Mr Depp to the Bahamas for Christmas and what Samantha 
McMillen saw, in terms of lack of any injuries on 16 December 2015. There was no reason for 
Ms McMillen to attend court in order to lie for Mr Depp. She was present when Ms Heard was 
being made up and would have seen if she was sporting two black eyes (and a broken/ swollen 
nose).  Similarly Kevin Murphy left Mr Depp’s employment some time ago. He has no vested 
interest in lying for Mr Depp. He saw Ms Heard in her bedroom and took photos of a clump of 
her hair on the carpet. But he was firm that the did not see any injuries to her face, although 
she was upset.

 "
DATE,132,20          later,," 
    15      A.  Yes.  Yes, there was no intentional headbutt. 
 
 
Page 511  
     14      A.  No, ma'am.  The collision was head to head, forehead to 
    15          forehead, or maybe side of head to forehead.  There was even a 
    16          moment where she says, ""I cannot believe"", in another tape, ""I 
    17          cannot believe you headbutted me.""  I said, ""I headbutted you 
    18          in the forehead.  How does that break your nose?""  I used the 
    19          word ""headbutt"" because that is how she referred to it.  The 
    20          collision was up here (indicating) and she had said that I had 
    21          broken her nose.  I do not see how that could break a nose. 
 
Page 512  
    17      Q. You say you did headbutt her, but did not cause those 
    18          injuries? 
 
    19      A.  I used the word ""headbutt"" in a later conversation, much 
    20          later, in fact, after we were well apart, and the divorce was 
    21          imminent.  I repeated the word that she used, ""headbutt"" ---- 
 
    22      Q.  Let us listen to that ---- 
 
    23      A.  ---- and I said, ""How does that break -- I headbutted you in 
 
    24          the forehead.  How does that break a nose?""  So, what I am 
    25          saying is headbutt as a collision. 
 
 Page 513  
     4      Q.  So in that conversation, Ms. Heard accuses you of headbutting 
     5          her.  You accept there was a headbutt, but you deny breaking 
     6          her nose.  Do you agree? 
 
     7      A.  I used the word ""headbutt"" as that was how Ms. Heard referred 
     8          to it.  I said, ""I headbutted you in the forehead.  That does 
     9          not break a nose."" 
 
    10      Q.  Yes. 
 
    11      A.  Yes, but it was not intentional headbutt. 
 
    12      Q.  I understand your account.  You say this was an accident. 
    13          When did you first hear or learn about that recording? 
 
    14      A.  Very recently.

    16          your account about this headbutt to deal with this recording?

    16          had to appear on a television show? 
 
    17      A.  That is correct, yes.

    19          that we have looked at in the photographs that I have shown 
    20          you a moment ago? 
 
    21      A.  That is correct.

    14          Ms. Heard that she did hit Mr. Depp in March 2015.  We have 
    15          your account of 21st April and the injuries you saw.  Are 
    16          those the only two incidents of injuries that Ms. Heard caused 
    17          to Mr. Depp that you know of? 
 
    18      A.  There was another incident in December in which he sustained 
    19          injuries from Ms. Heard -- Mr. Depp. 
 
    20      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute. (Pause) In December.  Can you 
    21          help me with which year? 
 
    22      A.  That would be 2015, sir. 
 
    23      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Thank you.

    20          what you know about this photo?

     5          top of his nose and it is a photo that I took with my personal 
     6          cell phone. 
 
     7      Q.  Can I just ask you to turn over the page to F894.093? 
 
     8      A.  Okay. 
 
     9      Q.  Do you see there another photograph?  Did you take this one? 
 
    10      A.  I did. 
 
    11      Q.  We can see that underneath -- perhaps you can describe rather 
    12          than me putting it to you.  What can we see on Mr. Depp's 
    13          face, around his eyes, if anything?

    15          see what appears to be a one and a half to two-inch vertical 
    16          scratch, and you can see redness to the right of that scratch.

2      A.  I saw the injury, the scratch that was on the top of his nose. 
     3          However, in this frontal shot, it is very hard to depict, and 
     4          there was redness on the side of his right cheek, which, in

     6          depict as well.

    11          forearms from trying to defend the blows.  I had two black 
    12          eyes.  I had a broken nose.  I had a broken lip.  I had 
    13          bruises primarily.  The really bad ones were in my hairline, 
    14          in my scalp, my chin ----

     7                Now, that was over the phone, that conversation, but the 
     8          very next day, so on 17th December, Erin Burin is in contact 
 
     9          with you to notify you that she will be able to deliver your 
    10          medications to your home.  So she turned up -- this is quite 
    11          late -- at 11 o'clock at night, and waited at the door for 
    12          several minutes after knocking.  You greeted her at the door 
    13          looking dishevelled, with your hair unbrushed, weepy and sad, 
    14          slouched posture, and you told Ms. Burin about an argument 
    15          with Mr. Depp.  Then there is a discussion about her offering 
   16          emotional support and that she could not stay.  It is this bit

    18          visible bright red blood appearing at centre of lower lip. 
    19          When RN made client aware that she was actively bleeding on 
    20          her lip, client stated it was from the injuries sustained in 
    21          the argument between her and her husband, and that it 
    22          continued to bleed actively.  Client also states that her head 
    23          is bruised and she lost clumps of hair in altercation.  RN 
    24          briefly looked at client's scalp, but was unable to visualise 
    25          the haematomas the client had described.  RN encouraged the

     4          Erin Burin, did you?

    17          I could not hear what caused the fight, Amber repeatedly 
    18          berated him with increasing ferocity.  She was insulting him, 
    19          calling him names, and in the middle of this onslaught I heard 
    20          her specifically say 'Your career is over, no one is going to "
DATE,153,about a year,,"    21          hire you, you're washed up, fat.  You will die a lonely man', 
    22          and also screaming things that were incomprehensible.  At some 
    23          point Johnny tried to leave again as they were now in the 
    24          parking lot.  He repeatedly asked for the key for the vehicle, 
    25          which she had taken out.  She refused to give it back to him 
P.2000 
 
     2          and which we later found in the house.  He was responding to 
     3          her verbal attacks by saying 'Go away and just leave me 
     4          alone'.  Amber's screaming and berating rose to a fever pitch 
     5          and Johnny continued to yell 'Go away and leave me alone'. 
    6          I asked Christi what I should do and she said I should keep an 
     7          eye on the situation as Amber's rage continued to escalate and 
     8          I described the scene to Christi.  She said that I needed to 
     9          intervene and I should go to Johnny's assistance.  I hung up 
    10          and immediately ran to the parking lot.  I saw Amber lunge at 
    11          Johnny, clawing, tugging and aggressively pulling him.  He 
    12          continued to stand there yelling at her to stop and leave him 
    13          alone.  When he stepped back to leave, her onslaught would 
    14          start again.  During the entire incident I never saw Johnny 
    15          hit Amber or push her back, nor did he physically react to the 
    16          attacks.  She would calm down and hug and apologise.  Then he 
    17          would say he needs to leave and it would start again.  Finally 
    18          I stepped between them.  She continued to reach for him but 
    19          maybe my presence stopped it.  I walked into the cafe and he 
    20          laid on the couch and that is when I saw that he now had a red 
    21          swelling gash on the bridge of his nose.  Amber, Johnny then 
    22          told me, had thrown a quart size can of lacquer thinner into 
    23          Johnny's face causing a gash.""  That is all true, is it not, 
    24          every single word? 
 
    25      A.  There are a few correct words in here that ""no one is ever

     3          are correct.

     9          attributed to you, but it is right that those words were said, 
    10          but actually they were said by Mr. Depp? 
 
    11      A.  Yes.  He continued to say them to me throughout and even after 
    12          the divorce, as he continued to threaten my job.  Also, I did 
    13          throw a can of something, I am later told that it was mineral 
    14          spirits.  I threw it in Johnny's direction as I was running 
    15          away from him.  But as I was running away from him, I had my 
   16          back to him, so I do not know if it actually made contact with

     4      Q.  You were asked by Ms. Wass, after the meeting, given how you 
     5          said you were upset, if you had taken cannabis, and you said, 
     6          quite fairly, that you are not sure, but you may have taken 
     7          cannabis, I think you said? 
 
     8      A.  It is possible that from the meeting which was held at my 
     9          office in the conference room, that on my way down to 
    10          Ms. Heard's dinner, it is possible that I would have smoked 
    11          some cannabis in the car on the way. 
 
    12      Q.  If you had smoked some cannabis, what effect would it have had 
    13          on you?  Would it have made you angry or in a rage? 
 
    14      A.  No, it is a calming agent.

11      Q.  When you met Mr. Depp in July 2016, so after the restraining 
    12          order, when it was still in place in fact but before the 
    13          divorce was finalised, do you remember that recording that we 
    14          have heard a lot about that was made of the meeting? 
 
    15      A.  Yes. 
 
    16      Q.  And do you remember there is a part of it in which he makes it 
    17          quite clear that he said, ""I did not want you to go to 
    18          Coachella, I left you because you haymakered me, you came 
    19          around the bed to start fucking punching on me"" and you did 
    20          not deny it, did you? 
 
    21      A.  No, that is not what I was having a conversation with him 
    22          about.

     4      MS. LAWS:  After the 21st, we are on the 22nd, so the morning you 
     5          saw Rocky, she came into the penthouse; that is right, is it 
     6          not? 
 
     7      THE WITNESS:  Yes. 
 
     8      Q.  You, in fact, did not mention or say at all that Mr. Depp had 
     9          hit you or assaulted you in any way, did you? 
 
    10      A.  That is not true.  I did. 
 
    11      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.  (Pause) 
 
    12      MS. LAWS:  I suggest that is absolutely untrue? 
 
    13      THE WITNESS:  I texted her that night and said, we had another 
    14          real bad one, which at that point was a well-recognised, 
    15          almost euphemism for a physical altercation.  Rocky knew very 
    16          well I meant that Johnny had hit me.  And I asked her to wake 
    17          me up specifically once she was ready -- well, ready to go in 
    18          the morning, and I managed to get a few hours of sleep.   
 
P.1765 
 
8      MS. LAWS:  What you said to Rocky is that you had a row.  I will 
     9          repeat the question again.  You at no stage informed Rocky 
    10          that Mr. Depp had hit you or assaulted you?

    10          characterised globally as, as the The Sun put it, ""a wife 
    11          beater"" and I went from, if you pardon the analogy, Cinderella 
    12          to Quasimodo in 0.6 seconds and I was without a voice at that 
    13          point.  Ms. Heard had made sure that the news media had caught 
    14          it and that is where I was in my life at that point, so it was 
    15          very unpleasant place to be.

19      MS. LAWS:  So, in each of those accounts, what you have not said 
    20          is that by the time you saw Rocky you were apart, but that is 
    21          the truth, is it?

    24          about it now?

     8      A.  H420? 
 
     9      Q.  Yes.  These are texts between Ms. Pennington and 
    10          iO Tillet Wright because at that point, you know now that 
    11          after you called out on the phone, ""Call 911"", iO Tillet 
    12          Wright called the police? 
 
    13      A.  Yes. 
 
    14      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  These are texts or messages of some kind. 
 
    15      MS. LAWS:  These are text messages between Ms. Pennington and 
    16          iO Tillet Wright.  What you can see here, if we just look at 
    17          this -- we do not need to look at them all -- is that on 21st 
    18          May, it says, 20:16, about a fifth of the way down, ""Are you 
    19          at Eastern?  JD attacking Amber.  She told me to call 911. 
    20          I am doing it."" 
 
    21      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.  (Pause) I am sorry, this is 
    22          H420.  Yes, ""JD attacking Amber.  She told me to call 911. I'm 
   23          doing it."" 
 
    24      MS. LAWS:  So that is Mr. Tillet Wright.  On the right, 
    25          Ms. Pennington says, ""Call me.""  Mr. Tillet Wright says, ""Does 
 
P.1656 
     2          she have her phone with her?""  Ms. Pennington says, ""Yes, she 
     3          is talking to her lawyer.""  Mr. Tillet Wright is saying, ""The 
     4          cops have her number"" and there is a question, ""Are they 
     5          indeed coming?""  Does that jog your memory? 
 
     6      A.  Yes. 
 
 
P.1657 
 
    21      MS. LAWS:  Now, do you say that Sean Bett was lying when he 
    22          indicated that Mr. Depp had not caused any damage in the 
    23          penthouse? 
 
    24      A.  I hesitate to call anyone a liar, but I do know for a fact 
   25          that Johnny did not have his own keys to that apartment, to 
 
P.1658 
 
     2          Penthouse 5.  Penthouse 5 is not the apartment where he 
     3          initially started to cause damage, but when he left, he not 
     4          only went into Penthouse 5, but he had to be let into it by 
     5          his security.

DATE,185,14      MS,," 
    14      Q.  So those officers must be lying -- they must be? 
 
    15      A.  I really do not want to call anyone a liar. 
 
    16      Q.  But there is no room for mistake, is there?  There are two 
    17          completely different accounts? 
 
    18      A.  It appears to be that they contradict one another, but I am 
    19          still uncomfortable calling anyone a liar. 
 
    20      Q.  They contradict you, do they not? 
 
    21      A.  I contradict them; they contradict me.  The accounts are 
    22          contradictory. 
 
    23      Q.  You have Josh Drew as well lying on your behalf saying that he 
    24          showed the officers around and pointed out the damage to them? 
 
    25      A.  He did. 
 
P.1667 
 
2      Q.  It is a total lie, is it not? 
 
     3      A.  Absolutely not. 
 
P.1668 
 
14      MS. LAWS:  It sounds like it is the female officer who was telling 
    15          you that it seemed unsafe.  Those were your words on the ---- 
 
    16      A.  Yes, but I do not know if that male officer also said that or 
    17          if that was what he indicated to me initially before I went 
    18          into the apartment with the female officer. 
 
    19      Q.  So it might have been the male or it might have been the 
    20          female; you do not know? 
 
    21      A.  That is not what I just said.  Let me clarify. 
 
    22      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  She said it might have been the male officer 
    23          or it might have been the female officer or it might have been 
    24          both. 
 
    25      A.  Yes, that is what I said. 
 
P.1669

     3      A.  No, that is not true.

    20          start at the top, so we do not appear to have the beginning of

     3      A.  Yes, in fact, Savannah was in the UK and I called ----

     5          UK, you were going to add something. 
 
     6      A.  I had tried to call her right before Johnny threw the phone in 
     7          my face. 
 
     8      MS. LAWS:  Was it because you, Rocky, and Drew, were all getting 
     9          your heads together and smashing up that apartment and putting 
    10          makeup on you to make you look injured in preparation?

    12          you smashing up the apartment"", and then you said something

    14      MS. LAWS:  Putting makeup on yourself to make yourself look 
    15          injured; were you doing that? 
 
    16      THE WITNESS:  No, I have never done that.  I was texting Savannah 
   17          to answer your question, I was texting Savannah because Johnny 
    18          became convinced, or had re-expressed, instead of coming over 
    19          to talk about his recently deceased mother and the fact we had 
    20          not spoken as a married couple, or seen each other, in nearly 
    21          a month, but Johnny came over to talk about was faecal matter. 
    22          And he was convinced at the time, it has changed since, but he 
    23          was convinced that it was Savannah, and/or my friend iO.  So, 
    24          my first calls and text messages were to Savannah and to iO,

 "
DATE,199,that day,," 
 
Mr  Bett  was  equally  adamant  that  he  did  not  know  the  names  of  the  LAPD  officers  who 
attended the penthouse that day. That was consistent with evidence gleaned from Ms Heard 
in cross-examination which suggested that her ‘camp’ was responsible for leaking the officer’s 
card to the media.

You are saying you did not

     4      THE WITNESS:  That is correct, sir. 
 
     5      MS. WASS:  We have heard from one of the officers, who indicated 
     6          that although her name appeared on an incident report, which 
     7          is an internal police document, there was no way the public 
     8          would have access to the identity of the two officers who

   12          depositions for Mr. Depp, not for Ms. Heard.  So, are you able

    14          officers was released to the Depp team in order to enable them

    10          body.  Having heard Ms. Wass's questions, do you want to 
    11          change that evidence at all? 
 
    12      A.  Not at all. 
 
    13      Q.  It was put to you, Mr. Bett -- and I should give you the 
    14          opportunity to comment on it -- that you are lying for 
    15          Mr. Depp.  That is what you have come here to do.  What do you 
    16          have to say about that? 
 
    17      A.  That is incorrect, sir. 
 
    18      Q.  Then, finally, you say in your statement, ""I could see 
    19          Mr. Depp was visibly upset at having been accused of hitting 
    20          Ms. Heard"". 
 
    21      A.  Correct. 
 
    22      Q.  Had you seen Mr. Depp be in this state before? 
 
    23      A.  No.

DATE,201,the week after,,"DAY 5 (Cross Examination of Trinity Esparza) 
 
Ms Esparza was clear that she had not confused Ms Heard with her sister, Whitney Henriques 
in the week after 21 May 2016. The fact that she had spoken to Ms Heard at close range was 
confirmed by the CCTV footage subsequently shown to Ms Heard in cross-examination. She 
had no animosity towards Ms Heard, she liked her; she has no reason to come to court and 
be untruthful. She was also clear that she knew makeup and Ms Heard well enough to know 
whether Ms Heard was, or was not, wearing any.

    24      A.  No, she said she used some moisturiser that she had used since 
    25          she was young. 
 
Page 884 
     2      Q.  I understand that, but moisturiser is quite different from

    25          Wednesday, as you have just told the court?

     3          any makeup on. 
 
     4      Q.  The idea of foundation and concealer is that it does not look 
     5          like you are wearing it.  That is what it is supposed to do? 
 
     6      A.  She had a very dewy glow.  I am a woman.  I wear makeup.  I 
     7          know the difference when someone is wearing makeup or not 
     8          wearing makeup.

     5          like you are wearing it.  That is what it is supposed to do? 
 
     6      A.  She had a very dewy glow.  I am a woman.  I wear makeup.  I 
     7          know the difference when someone is wearing makeup or not 
     8          wearing makeup.

DATE,205,"14          Saturday, 21st May",,"     3      MR. SHERBORNE:  Ms. Esparza, I do not have many questions for you. 
     4          You started out your answers to Ms. Wass by saying that you 
     5          liked Ms. Heard; is that correct. 
 
     6      A.  Yes.  She has always been very sweet to me.

    11      A.  What is rare?  She lived in the building.  I saw her often. 
 
    12      Q.  I think you have answered the question.  Can I just ask you 
    13          this, just to go through the dates.  We have obviously 
    14          Saturday, 21st May, when you were not on duty.  Have you got

    17      Q.  It is not meant to be a memory test.  You can have it in front

    19          not on duty on May 22nd, you received the call from 
    20          Mr. Harrell, which I think you were going to say something 
    21          about and then Ms. Wass stopped you.  Do you want to explain 
    22          very briefly what you heard from Mr. Harrell? 
 
    23      A.  He was very excited because he met her for the first time.  He

     4      Q.  Yes.  If you look on your witness statement, on 23rd May, can 
     5          you see paragraph 12.  Do you see the last sentence, you say: 
     6          ""I looked her right in the face"" -- she was only a few feet 
     7          away -- ""as we said hello and I saw no visible injuries

    23      Q.  Again, 24th May, you see her, and you say the same thing 
    24          again.  You saw her in close proximity and, once again, you 
    25          did not see any physical injuries to her face; true or not

     5          the 25th.  If you look at the last couple of sentences, you 
     6          said:  ""Ms. Heard was not wearing any makeup at that time."" 
     7          When you were that close to her, a few feet away, would you 
     8          have been able to tell or not whether she was wearing makeup? 
 
     9      A.  Yes. 
 
    10      Q.  And you said to her that her skin looked flawless; is that 
    11          correct? 
 
    12      A.  Correct. 
 
    13      Q.  Had you seen the injuries like the ones that I have shown you, 
    14          would you have said to Ms. Heard that her skin looked 
    15          flawless?

     4          letting you answer a question. 
 
     5      A.  I was just agreeing with you. 
 
     6      Q.  Now, this meeting with Ms. Heard, which you describe as an 
     7          encounter, was that something that was planned or by chance? 
 
     8      A.  It was by chance. 
 
     9      Q.  So, Ms. Heard had no idea, when you turned up on May 24th, 
    10          that you were coming?

     4          bruises, cuts or injuries to her face, or any other part of 
     5          her body.""  Having been shown a few photographs of what 
     6          Ms. Heard has taken, on 21st May and I think you were shown 
     7          27th May, do you want to change your evidence as to how you 
     8          saw her in that chance encounter on the 24th at all?

    11          daylight hours?

    13      Q.  Did you get a clear look at her?

    15          sundress, hippie dress that she had on, something that I have 
    16          seen her many times before wearing, just like a regular hippie 
    17          schmutter dress.

     7          that you have described to us? 
 
     8      A.  The hippie dress, not as good of a recollection.  The light, 
     9          absolutely. 
 
    10      Q.  Right. 
 
    11      A.  Absolutely.

Ms Heard’s conduct after 21 May 2016 when she was seeking to get hold of Mr Depp were 
inconsistent with the notion that she was “petrified” of him as she declared in order to obtain 
a Temporary Restraining Order against him.  
 
It was also notable in her evidence that she refused to accept what was written in black and 
white by the attorneys who she had engaged to represent her, whether it was what they said 
about the alleged abuse or what their demands of Mr Depp entailed in order, they said on her 
behalf, to resolve the divorce amicably.

inconsistent with the notion that she was “petrified” of him as she declared in order to obtain 
a Temporary Restraining Order against him.  
 
It was also notable in her evidence that she refused to accept what was written in black and 
white by the attorneys who she had engaged to represent her, whether it was what they said 
about the alleged abuse or what their demands of Mr Depp entailed in order, they said on her 
behalf, to resolve the divorce amicably.

     6          I suggest you would have done if you are telling the truth, 
     7          what she would have put in this letter is, ""He was violent on 
     8          the 21st and he has been violent on so many incidents, a 
     9          number of incidents in the last six months.""

    12      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  I think what is being put to you, Ms. Heard, 
    13          is that had Mr. Depp been violent to you on more than the 
    14          three occasions that are mentioned in this letter, your lawyer

    19          site, if she came at all.  It is a different part of the

    16      A.  Oh.  No, she specifically told me that this was a short 
    17          application, we only had a certain amount of pages, a certain 
    18          amount of space, and that there was frankly no need to, 
    19          because if you hit a person, a partner, your wife once, it 
    20          would be, it would qualify me for the restraining order I was 
    21          seeking.  So, for ease, comfort to my own wellbeing and mental 
    22          health, she just said, ""Give me the last, you know, last 
    23          couple"" and that is what I did. 
 
    24      MS. LAWS:  No, what she is saying here is that in the last six 
    25          months, there have been three incidents, so that suggests that 
 
P.1726 
2          you did not tell her there were any more than that, did you? 
 
     3      A.  She told me I did not need to tell her everything, that I just 
     4          needed to remember the last couple. 
… 
 
12      Q.  Can I ask you about the next paragraph:  ""Amber wishes to work 
    13          quite quickly towards a private amicable resolution, but she 
    14          will need Johnny's immediate cooperation to do so. ...(reads 
    15          to the words)... exclusive use and possession of Penthouses 1, 
    16          3 and 5"" and then fees.  So, effectively, you are wanting him 
    17          to agree straightaway, and that letter has got a veiled threat 
    18          in it, has it not, that the violence is something that could 
    19          and would be used.  Do you agree? 
 
    20      A.  No, I do not agree.  A TRO is a public record whether you like 
    21          it or not. 
 
    22      MR. JUSTICE NICOL:  Just a minute.  (Pause) 
 
    23      MS. LAWS:  What that letter is effectively is is blackmail, is it 
    24          not? 
 
    25      A.  No, a TRO (a temporary restraining order), as is a divorce or 
 
P.1727 
     2          a divorce filing, is a public record whether you like it or 
     3          not, and all I wanted was for Johnny to leave me alone. "

    15          possibly keeping the divorce under wraps for as long as 
    16          possible.  As naive as it sounds to hear myself say it now, at 
    17          the time, I thought the way that we had gone about filing for 
    18          the divorce on a Friday afternoon, late, it could stay under

     2      Q.  But I went through yesterday ---- "
DATE,222,the 25th,,"    13          trying to get a hold of him by phone to let him know about the 
    14          divorce, to let him know about what I recently learned about 
    15          possibly keeping the divorce under wraps for as long as 
    16          possible.  As naive as it sounds to hear myself say it now, at 
    17          the time, I thought the way that we had gone about filing for 
    18          the divorce on a Friday afternoon, late, it could stay under 
    19          wraps potentially for a few days and those few days were 
    20          precious few days of privacy in the hardest time of my life, 
    21          and presumably difficult for Johnny as well.  I would have 
    22          done anything to have those few days of privacy and I wanted 
    23          Johnny to know that.  I would argue that is very different 
    24          from not being scared of him or being scared of him. 
 
    25      Q.  You see, I challenge that.  What you were doing during that 
 
P.1733 
 
2          day was displaying a determination to get his answer to see if 
     3          your demands were going to be met, but you disagree? 
 
     4      A.  My demands? 
 
     5      Q.  Yes, the demands in the letter that I have read out to you? 
 
     6      A.  The demands I was asking for were simply to let him know we 
     7          had filed and for him, for me, to know that we could do it 
     8          amicably and potentially as privately as possible, even if it 
     9          was just keeping it under wraps for a few days. 
 
    10      Q.  You were contacting him to talk about that; do you agree, yes 
    11          or no? 
 
P.1735 
 
    13      Q.  And there is a text -- and the number of it is 9525 in the 
    14          left-hand column -- from you to Mr. Depp, on the 25th, in what 
    15          looks like the early hours:  ""Just confirmed that that cover 
    16          letter is completely private...(reads to the words)... why 
    17          that happened and was scared."" Just pause there a moment.  We 
    18          have just seen a number of texts and we have gone over this. 
    19          You called the lawyer before the police arrived, did you not?

     8          acrimonious than it already was. 
 
     9      Q.  You did not want him to agree to what you had asked for?

    12          complicated time, but I just wanted privacy and kindness.

    14          end of the text, do we not?

    16          months, days, weeks, leading up to that and on our phone 
    17          calls, I do not know what we had talked about to be honest. 
    18          I wanted it to be as private as possible.  And from what 
    19          I understood at the time from my solicitors is that the way 
    20          the procedure works it that there is a chance that there could 
    21          be exposed quickly or there is a chance it can fly under the 
    22          radar for a certain amount of time.  As naive as it is, 
    23          looking back on it from where I sit now, a few days would not 
    24          have made huge difference, but at the time a few days of 
    25          privacy would have made an enormous difference to me.  And
