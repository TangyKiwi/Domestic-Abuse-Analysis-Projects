on  21  July  2020  Ms  Laws  QC  put  to  Ms  Heard  in  cross-examination  that  this  photograph  was 
in  fact  taken  on  23  March  2020.  This  assertion  was  made  on  the  basis  of  the  travel  documents 
of  Jan  McLagan  [11/  Tabs  148  and  149]:  see  Transcript,  Day  11,  pages  1810—18  17. 
Ms  Heard’s  evidence  was  that  “I  do  not  know  when  it  [this  photograph]  was  taken  ”  but  her 
bottom  lip  in  this  photograph  looked  swollen  to  her  (Day  11,  pages  1810,  lines  10-17  and 
pages  1817-18). 
Ms  Henriquez’  evidence  was  that  in  this  photograph  “J  see  makeup  and  a  split  lip.”  (Day  13, 
page  2156,  lines  19-20). "

Bandage  makes  it  look  worse  -  half  of  it  will  probably  come  off  trmw  or  Tuesday,  I'll 
speak  to  Joe  and  Kenny  to  let  them  know  that  we  will  have  to  figure  something  house 
hand-wise  altho  we  did  spk  about  Cpt  Jack  having  an  injury,  so  it  could  be  something... 
We'll  have  a  brain  storm  on  it.  Hopefully  Kipper  will  put  him  to  sleep  tonight  and  he  can

grab  his  bag  I  then  went  over  to  the  couch  to  console  Amber,  who 
curled  up  in  my  arms,  saying  ""I  didn't  do  anything,  I just  called  lo

random  accusations  specifically  at  Amber  throughout.  He  grabs 
his  bag  &  the  wine,  makes  to  leave,  then  turns  around  and  comes 
back  towards  us,  walks  right  up  in  front  of us  (still  on  the  couch),

this  point  his  security,  Jerry  &  Sean  came  in.  As  soon  as  they 
come  in,  he  retreated  away,  about  15 feet.  Amber  got  up  to  head 
towards  the  bathroom,  telling  Jerry  that  if he  ""hits  me  one  more 
time  I'm  calling  the  cops.""  Johnny  denied  that  he  had  struck  her. 
He  said  that  he  had  ""thrown  her  phone  at  her,  and  that's 
what  she's  accusing  me  of.""  Amber  then  repeated  what  she  had 
said  before  ""I  didn't  do  anything,  if he  hits  me  one  more  time  I'm 
calling  the  cops.""  He  then  went  into  the  kitchen  area  and  started 
smashing  things  at  random.  His  security  did  nothing  but  stand 
behind  him.  No  effort  was  made  to  restrain  him,  no 
acknowledgment  was  made  of the  abuse,  nor  did  they  make  any 
verbal  effort  to  try  and  diffuse  the  situation  or  get  him  to  walk 
away.  He  then  stormed  out  of the  apartment,  screaming 
unintelligibly.  That  was  the  last  I  saw  of him  that  evening.  I  heard 
him  yelling  and  breaking  things for  the  next  I ‘5-30  minutes  in  the 
hallway  and  other  apartments.  When  I  went  to  find  Amber's  phone 
and  purse  in  PH3  and  PHS,  still  not  knowing  if he  was  on  the 
premises,  I  discovered  broken  belongings.  This  included  my  art 
that  had  been  thrown  against  the  wall,  Amber's  office  that  had 
been  ransacked,  framed photos  that  had  been  smashed  and  glass 
broken,  and  art  that  had  been  taken  from  the  wall  and  left  on  the 
bed  in  Amber's  room  .  In  the  public  hallway  there  were  puddles  of 
spilled  wine  on  the floor  and  splashed  on  the  walls,  and  dents  in 
the  doors.  Amber  was  in  my  apartment  (PHI)  when  the  police 
arrived.  To  my  knowledge  he  had  already  vacated  the  premises.
