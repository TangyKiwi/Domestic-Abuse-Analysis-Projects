This repository holds the code of multiple projects related to domestic abuse analysis that I developed at my time at Worldie. Please refer to the descriptions below, or see each projects' individual READMEs for more details.

## AdminLTE-3.2.0
Timeline implementation of `Timeline` and `Evidence Scraper`. Download the repo and run `index.html` to view or visit <a href="https://tangykiwi.tk/Worldie/annex.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Evidence Scraper
Scrapes and compiles evidence files from the Depp / Heard case and other domestic violence cases. Also contains an audio file scraper which reads `wav` files to `txt` (STT).

## RedHeart
Scrapes and compiles all cases from the RedHeart database. Also contains Jupyter notebooks visualizing all the data.

## Social Media Scraper
Tools to scrape a given user's social media profile page.

## Timeline
Scrapes and compiles date-times of pdfs from the Depp v NGN case. Attempts to create a timeline using the date-time evidence scraped.

## app
Proof of concept for a dockerfile to load python projects.
