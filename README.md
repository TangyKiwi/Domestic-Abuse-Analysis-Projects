This repository holds the code of multiple projects related to domestic abuse analysis that I developed at my time at Worldie. Please refer to the descriptions below, or see each projects' individual README's for more details.

The end goal (albeit far), is to create a comprehensive program that is able to scan social media accounts and analyze posts, comments, etc. for signs of domestic abuse. Additionally, this program would also be able to compile the data and display it. Currently all projects hold a portion of this master program, with the AdminLTE suite project being the most visually representative. Please view the result [here](https://tangykiwi.github.io/Worldie/annex.html).

## AdminLTE-3.2.0
Timeline implementation of `Timeline` and `Evidence Scraper` using the AdminLTE suite. Download the repo and run `index.html` to view or visit [here](https://tangykiwi.github.io/Worldie/annex.html).

## Evidence Scraper
Scrapes and compiles evidence files from the Depp / Heard case and other domestic violence cases. Also contains an audio file scraper which reads `wav` files to `txt` (STT).

## RedHeart
Scrapes and compiles all cases from the RedHeart database. Also contains Jupyter notebooks visualizing all the data.

## Social Media Scraper
Tools to scrape a given user's social media profile page.

## Timeline
Scrapes and compiles date-times of pdfs from the Depp v NGN case. Attempts to create a timeline using the date-time evidence scraped.

## app
Proof of concept for a dockerfile to load python projects.
