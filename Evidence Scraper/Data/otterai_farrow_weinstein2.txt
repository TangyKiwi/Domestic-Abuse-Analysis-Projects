I tried to struggle away but he's a big guy, you know, so he, he overpowering me, but I don't know if, like, if along the process if I just sort of I think I just sort of gave up, right? I mean, and that's where I feel like if it had been like, Oh no, he like 1,000% forced me and I was like screaming and like fighting him to the desk. I would feel like a little more proud, right this whole situation but I think I just gave up and just said I'm just gonna do this like I'm just barely an answer. And it's it was horrible part of it and that's why he's been able to do this for so long. Give up and and they feel like it's their fault. You know? You gotta always clear cut things. I mean, I feel like a lot of people would be coming forward earlier, but it's never clear cut but power is a very real thing and intimidation is very honestly.
